      "\n",
      "LONDON/BOGOTA, Oct 10 (Reuters) - When Vernon Hill launched Metro Bank in 2010, his Yorkshire terrier tucked under one arm, he vowed the upstart lender would challenge the dominance of Britain's big banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the challenger banks have struggled to shake up a market dominated by the \"Big Four\" of Lloyds (LLOY.L), NatWest (NWG.L), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Barclays (BARC.L), with Metro's eleventh-hour weekend capital injection highlighting the hurdles they face.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Metro, which used to offer dog biscuits for customers' pets, was Britain's first new high street bank in more than 150 years, it was soon followed by other new entrants, such as fast-growing digital lenders Monzo and Starling Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Metro's refinancing package will see its shareholders heavily diluted and some bondholders take a haircut, markets welcomed the deal, with the bank's battered shares gaining 11% on Monday and climbing further on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe it's just the least worst outcome now and a bitter pill that just needs to be necked,\" said John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creditors also appear in favour of the deal, with support secured just shy of the 75% threshold needed as of Monday, two sources familiar with the situation said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bondholders include Caius Capital, Kite Lake and Varde Partners, another source said. All three declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro declined to comment on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundraising package will also hand Metro's biggest shareholder, the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski, a controlling stake in the bank. Gilinski, whose daughter Dorita is on Metro's board, will inject 102 million pounds to take a 53% stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engineer and Harvard graduate - who is Colombia's fourth richest man with a fortune of $5 billion, according to Forbes - has further ambitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A source with knowledge of the matter said Gilinski planned to acquire further UK banking assets over time and was monitoring other opportunities, building on his experiences buying a string of banks in Latin America.\n",
      "\n",
      "'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD'\n",
      "\n",
      "British regulators and lawmakers have long wanted the challengers to take on the bigger banks, but progress has been slow as they have largely failed to achieve the scale needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some have made a dent in the current account market - with Monzo for instance amassing 8.4 million customers - few have entered or made real headway in key markets such as mortgage lending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain's 10 largest mortgage lenders still accounted for 83% of the market at the end of last year, data published by banking trade body UK Finance shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monzo declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Starling spokesperson said the lender was making inroads into the big banks' market dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've demonstrated that we can scale,\" the spokesperson said. \"We reported profits of 195 million pounds for the year to the end of March 2023, the second full consecutive year of profitability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some challengers have criticized Britain's capital rules for hampering competition, leading the Bank of England to pledge to introduce a \"strong and simple\" capital regime for smaller banks, although the reform has yet to be implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two sources close to Metro said the capital rules had been a key contributing factor to its problems, which began in the years after it floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There has to be a level playing field,\" one added.\n",
      "\n",
      "After failing to obtain key capital relief and faced with looming debt maturities, Metro last month enlisted Morgan Stanley to advise it, people familiar with the move said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bank of England then stepped in to find potential buyers for Metro in case refinancing talks failed, which could have been more painful for investors, the people added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain's principal banking regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But some of Metro's problems were of its own making, said Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, such as an accounting error in 2019 that ultimately led to Hill's departure as chairman and marked a turning point for the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many of the major setbacks were behind it before its 925 million pound ($1.1 billion) financing package, Metro's share price was down 98% from the time of its float.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some analysts say several problems remain for Metro, including a high-cost branch model, but the bank is betting a shift into higher margin lending, including specialist mortgages and commercial loans, will pay off.\n",

      "Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\n",
      "\n",
      "CONSOLIDATION?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tough economic conditions are clouding the outlook for the challenger banks, in some cases raising concerns around potential loan losses and high funding costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's hard to see how investors will rally behind (smaller players),\" said Rupak Ghose, corporate strategist and former financials analyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest rate rises have also bumped up the costs of attracting customer deposits, particularly for those reliant on interest-paying savings accounts, and intensified competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shore Capital's Greenwood said most challenger banks were profitable and had proven adaptable, but said higher rates could pressure less specialised lenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markets regulator the Financial Conduct Authority said competition had increased in the banking sector and it was continuing its work to improve this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro is not the only smaller bank to have faced problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July, shares in OSB Group (OSBO.L) slid after the midsize specialist lender said it would take a hit of up to 180 million pounds due to changing customer behaviour.\n",

      "OSB Group declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",

      "MARRAKECH, Morocco, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund and World Bank wrapped up annual meetings in Morocco on Sunday with some progress towards increasing their lending resources but confronting a new economic shock from the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussions in the tourist hub of Marrakech, not far from the epicenter of a devastating September earthquake, focused on a flagging global economy weighed down by debt, inflation and conflict, a growing wealth gap between rich and poor countries and floundering efforts to tackle climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the main takeaways:\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME FUNDING PROGRESS\n",
      "\n",
      "IMF member countries pledged to increase quota contributions by year-end to help ensure the Fund has adequate lending firepower to respond to another large-scale crisis. They fell short of agreeing to a U.S. plan that would delay shareholding changes that would cede more influence to China, with more talks in the next two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank's governing body approved its new vision statement to \"create world free of poverty on a liveable planet,\" incorporating its new mission to tackle climate change, and endorsed new steps to allow the use of debt-like hybrid capital and a new portfolio guarantee platform that could together yield up to $100 billion in new lending over a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "NO CONSENSUS ON MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamas' attack on Israel upset a carefully crafted script for the meetings, but IMF and World Bank leaders were slow to respond to risks presented by the conflict, ranging from higher energy prices, potential trade impacts and a new refugee crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "G20 finance leaders and the steering committees of both institutions also failed to issue joint communiques due to disagreement over Russia's invasion of Ukraine war, but unlike the strong condemnation of the Hamas attacks by G7 democracies, the larger, more diverse groups failed to mention the Middle East conflict\n",
      "\n",
      "'LIMPING' ECONOMY\n",
      "\n",
      "The new IMF outlook - signed off before the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas - sees global economic growth slowing from 3.5% last year to 3% this year and 2.9% next year, a 0.1% point downgrade from a previous 2024 estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global inflation is seen dropping from 6.9% this year to a still-high 5.8% next. Central bankers signalled readiness to end interest rate hikes if events allow, hopeful that inflation can be finally tamed without too hard a landing. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas described the global economy as \"limping along, not sprinting\".\n",
      "\n",
      "DEBT SQUEEZE\n",
      "\n",
      "The heavy debt burdens of advanced economies - from the United States to China and Italy - was a recurrent theme in the meetings, which came after financial markets in recent weeks pushed U.S. bond yields higher. Italian central bank governor Ignazio Visco said there was an impression markets were \"reevaluating the term premium\" as investors become more nervous about holding longer term debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPMorgan chair of global research Joyce Chang put it another way. \"The bond vigilantes are back, and the Great Moderation is over,\" she told a panel of the two-decade era of relative economic calm before the 2008/09 financial crisis.\n",

      "One policy area where this could have a knock-on effect is the fight against climate change. Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMF's fiscal division, warned current subsidies-based policies were failing to deliver net zero emissions and that scaling them up would explode public debt without carbon pricing to generate revenue.\n",

      "RISKS SKEWED TO DOWNSIDE\n",
      "\n",
      "High interest rates will put some borrowers in more precarious positions, the IMF warned in its Global Financial Stability Report. Around 5% of banks globally are vulnerable to stress if those rates remain higher for longer, it estimated, and a further 30% of banks - including some of the world's largest - would be vulnerable if the global economy enters a prolonged period of low growth and high inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "JOSTLING FOR INFLUENCE\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ukraine war, growing trade protectionism and tensions between the United States and China are all making consensus-building tougher. There was much talk ahead of Marrakech on revamping the IMF and World Bank to better reflect the emergence of economies like China and Brazil, but actions taken at the meetings may delay them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The big theme this week is G7 countries papering over the cracks of shattered promises,\" said Kate Donald, Head of Oxfam International's Washington DC Office. \"Despite the wringing of hands about the billions of dollars needed to tackle poverty and climate breakdown, there has been no sign of new money.\"\n",

      "“As the global community gathers in Marrakech, we need to stand together, united in the goal of protecting our future prosperity and ending extreme poverty. Prospects for global growth in the medium-term are at their lowest level in decades. The scarring effects of successive crises are increasingly apparent, just as many countries are struggling to overcome high inflation, high debt, and significant financing shortfalls to provide basic services, support infrastructure and climate action, and address rising poverty, inequality, and fragility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The world has become more shock-prone, with increased risks to growth, development, jobs, and living standards that widen inequalities within and across countries. Emerging market and developing economies have been especially hard hit. Income divergence with advanced economies has deepened further, and the world is not on a path to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our understanding of the major risks and disruptive forces facing the global economy has evolved: the existential threat posed by climate change, growing disparities in income and opportunity, and geopolitical tensions are intensifying. Rapid digitalization and technological transformations create new challenges, but also opportunities, and no country should be left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marrakech 2023 is a call for enhanced global collaborative action on common challenges, so we can build resilience and expand opportunities for a better future.\n",

      "\n",
      "American banks are closing out another quarter in which interest rates surged, reviving concerns about shrinking margins and rising loan losses — though some analysts see a silver lining to the industry's woes. Just as they did during the March regional banking crisis, higher rates are expected to lead to a jump in losses on banks' bond portfolios and contribute to funding pressures as institutions are forced to pay higher rates for deposits. KBW analysts Christopher McGratty and David Konrad estimate banks' per-share earnings fell 18% in the third quarter as lending margins compressed and loan demand sank on higher borrowing costs. \"The fundamental outlook is hard near term; revenues are declining, margins are declining, growth is slowing,\" McGratty said in a phone interview. Earnings season kicks off Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo . Bank stocks have been intertwined closely with the path of borrowing costs this year. The S&P 500 Banks index sank 9.3% in September on concerns sparked by a surprising surge in longer-term interest rates, especially the 10-year yield, which jumped 74 basis points in the quarter. Rising yields mean the bonds owned by banks fall in value, creating unrealized losses that pressure capital levels. The dynamic caught midsized institutions including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic off guard earlier this year, which — combined with deposit runs — led to government seizure of those banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big banks have largely dodged concerns tied to underwater bonds, with the notable exception of Bank of America . The bank piled into low-yielding securities during the pandemic and had more than $100 billion in paper losses on bonds at midyear. The issue constrains the bank's interest revenue and has made the lender the worst stock performer this year among the top six U.S. institutions. Expectations on the impact of higher rates on banks' balance sheets varied. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Betsy Graseck said in an October 2 note that the \"estimated impact from the bond rout in 3Q is more than double\" losses in the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardest-hit banks\n",
      "\n",
      "Bond losses will have the deepest impact on regional lenders including Comerica , Fifth Third Bank and KeyBank , the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Still, others including KBW and UBS analysts said that other factors could soften the capital hit from higher rates for most of the industry. \"A lot will depend on the duration of their books,\" Konrad said in an interview, referring to whether banks owned shorter or longer-term bonds. \"I think the bond marks will look similar to last quarter, which is still a capital headwind, but that there'll be a smaller group of banks that are hit more because of what they own.\" There's also concern that higher interest rates will result in ballooning losses in commercial real estate and industrial loans. \"We expect loan loss provisions to increase materially compared to the third quarter of 2022 as we expect banks to build up loan loss reserves,\" RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote in a Oct. 2 note.\n",

      "\n",
      "NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said Wednesday while the odds of the economy escaping a recession have grown, it’s possible the central bank is not done with interest rate hikes aimed at bringing inflation back to its target.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I expect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2%,” Collins said in a speech text. “And while we are likely near, and could be at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted depending on incoming information,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Fed having raised rates from near zero levels in the spring of 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.5% range, Collins, who does not have a vote on the rate setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, said now is a time for the Fed to take its time to decide what its next move will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Patience will give us time to better separate ‘signal’ from ‘noise’ in the data and to balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to work through the economy,” Collins said. That the Fed has shifted to this stance reflects the need to balance out risks of inflation remaining too high against slowing the economy too much, the official said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins’ remarks came after the release of meeting minutes from the Fed’s September gathering. Then, officials held rates steady but kept the option alive of raising them again even as inflation pressures have been cooling. In recent comments, a slew of officials have cited rising bond market yields, which should create restraint on the economy, as a factor that may allow them to call it a day on their rate hike cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her speech, Collins said it appears the savings levels are starting to dry up and because of that the economy is likely to become more responsive to changes in monetary policy, suggesting Fed policy is likely to weigh on the data more than it has.\n",

      "Collins said the economy has been surprisingly resilient in the face of Fed action and she believes the path to achieving a soft landing has grown.\n",

      "With each lost percent, 100 million people are pulled into poverty and another 50 million people are pushed into extreme poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dig deeper and you’ll find people struggling to provide for themselves and their families as incomes have stagnated. In Sub-Saharan Africa per capita income is the same as it was 14 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, debt has increased throughout emerging markets – doubling in Africa – shackling countries to the ground just as they’re trying to rise.\n",

      "Beneath the surface, a growing mistrust is pulling the Global North and South apart, complicating the prospect of progress.\n",

      "\n",
      "The World Bank is turning to face the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evolution began months ago, and today there is a new vision and mission for the World Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a world free of poverty – on a livable planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But time is of the essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This urgency motivated us to write a new playbook – a new mission. One that will drive impactful development and lead to a better quality of life – access to clean air, clean water, education and decent health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a mission that is inclusive of everyone, including women and young people;\n",
      "\n",
      "Resilient to shocks, including against climate and biodiversity crises, pandemics and fragility;\n",
      "\n",
      "And sustainable, through growth and job creation, human development, fiscal and debt management, food security and access to clean air, water, and affordable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this vision, we are widening the aperture of the World Bank, reflecting a reality that the luxury of choice was for the last generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confront the intertwined challenges, our only option is to respond aggressively, simultaneously, and comprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot make adequate progress on public health while rising temperatures change the patterns of infectious diseases and breed pandemics.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can’t help farmers expand crop yields and feed growing populations using techniques that were not designed for years long droughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we will never reliably connect entrepreneurs with markets if the roads they rely on for shipping get washed away every year in a flood.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why we need a new playbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the center must be women and young people.\n",

      "We cannot defeat poverty with half the world’s population on the sideline.\n",
      "\n",
      "And young people, they can be the engine of our future; but only if we provide quality of life when they’re growing up – and then a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a job comes dignity, pride, the ability to provide for yourself and your family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a job – or the hope of one – human despair turns to anger, in those moments people grasp for any hand that offers a way out. Those costs can deliver irreparable harm on a society – or – on entire generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The urgency and importance cannot be overstated. Our own estimates project that in the next 10 years, 1.1 billion young people across the Global South will become working age adults. Yet, in the same period and same countries, we are only expected to create 325 million jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of inaction is unimaginable – this demographic dividend must not be allowed to become a demographic challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "This vision and mission will test the sincerity of our ambition – it sets us on a journey that will require reimagined partnerships, a new way of working and thinking, an innovative plan to scale and replicate, additional resources, and optimism for what could be possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the new direction of the World Bank and what I am excited to share with you today.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took our first steps on this journey in April, squeezing $40 billion over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan to equity ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "And over the last few months, we dug even deeper, creating a portfolio guarantee mechanism and launching a hybrid capital instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new tools enable us to take more risks and boost our lending capacity further – all while preserving our AAA rating. Taken together we could provide $157 billion more in lending capacity over a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our work has been met with enthusiasm – and generosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germany moved first to support hybrid capital, their contribution will give us €2.4 billion in additional IBRD lending over the next 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the United States’ early support for portfolio guarantees could unlock roughly $25 billion in new IBRD lending – and we expect others to join in soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes these tools unique – and a good investment – is their ability to leverage every dollar six to eight times over 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are not stopping there.\n",
      "\n",
      "With other multilateral development banks, we are exploring ways to better utilize callable capital and SDRs. Both are complicated but achievable. Unlocking their potential will take time and requires action from shareholders and central banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see other opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Global Public Goods Fund was designed to incentivize cooperation across borders and tackle shared challenges. But, in the past, the funding came only from IBRD’s income, holding back its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we’re opening the door to governments and philanthropies, which could grow concessional resources. With this bigger ambition and ability to deliver on our new mission we believe this will be a true Livable Planet Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know this model can work. In a big step forward, Uruguay became the first country to take advantage of reduced interest rates as a direct result of meeting climate performance targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "An innovative approach that we aim to scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we are continuing to test other ideas across our ecosystem of incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re exploring maturities of 35 to 40 years to help countries navigate longer term horizons for social and human capital investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re investigating if we can reduce interest rates to incentivize exiting from coal as part of energy transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in countries that utilize both IDA and IBRD, we’re looking to find ways to encourage a renewable energy transition by increasing concessional finance in the mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "This spirit of innovation and exploration is comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank stepped forward to support the most vulnerable when compounding challenges – the War in Ukraine, effects of the pandemic, and inflation – hit. But the need was so great that we allocated the majority of our three-year Crisis Response Window in the first year.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, we need to replenish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our objective is to raise $4 billion for the Crisis Response Window Plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States is requesting $1 billion from Congress. And other countries – like the Nordics – are pledging donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we are a long way from our goal and time is short.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are looking for others to step forward. We need our donors’ help to reload this fund and carry us through our next IDA cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we really want to incentivize change – we can’t just wish it – we need to fight for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere is this truer than IDA. We are pushing the limits of this important concessional resource and no amount of creative financial engineering will compensate for the fact that we need more funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "This must drive each of us to make the next replenishment of IDA the largest of all time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need donors, shareholders, and philanthropies to step up, join us, and bring their ambition to this fight, otherwise these instruments are just theoretical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, we aren’t waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are recruiting new partners and reimagining partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are joining with others, working alongside multilateral development banks to coordinate global action, catalyze change, and multiply impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my first trip, Ilan Goldfajn from the InterAmerican Development Bank and I visited Peru and Jamaica to make purposeful what too often has been accidental – collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our partnership focuses on three objectives: attack deforestation the Amazon, strengthen the Caribbean’s resilience to natural disasters, and bridge the digital-access gap across Latin America and the Caribbean.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not deliver results overnight but together our impact will be greater than it would be on our own. That is why the World Bank is reaching out to other institutions in hopes of establishing similar partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "That spirit of common cause is shared among multilateral development banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are oriented toward impact and the competition of the past has begun to give way. We recognize there is much we can do together, but in these early days we are focusing our energy on four areas that will lift us all.\n",
      "\n",
      "One, we are working with credit rating agencies to help improve their understanding of our work and risks. They are integral to unlocking capital and pricing. Without progress, ideas like callable capital will be out of reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two, we are expanding collaboration on joint financing. Establishing a Co-Financing Platform to facilitate coordination across global and regional priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three, we are standardizing our processes, reducing transaction costs, and freeing up technical capacity. Already we are making progress on procurement and streamlining environmental and social frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, we are developing a new approach to track climate outcomes based on impact. We plan to share more about our progress at COP28 in Dubai.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unified approach could greatly benefit the governments we serve, making it easier for them to access resources from a diverse set of multilateral development banks, focusing lending through a single country platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the World Bank – and my friends in the other multilateral development banks – don’t have a monopoly on good ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should steal shamelessly – and share seamlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we must do it with – and among – think tanks, the private sector, civil society, and – anyone who is moving the needle.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is much we can do together but this commitment to impact begins with ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank has launched an ambitious program to quicken our pace, increase our efficiency, and simplify our processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that when development is delayed – development is denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the numbers, one year without education reduces a person’s future income by 10 percent annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depriving a child of proper nutrition in their first 1,000 days, decreases their income by around 17 percent every year – for the rest of their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, at the World Bank, we are spending the same amount of time on a difficult project, like a 2,000-mile transmission line that traverses conflict zones and critical environments, as we do constructing a small solar grid or new school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our teams spend months preparing reports that evaluate risk from every angle – 4,880 days of staff time each year just on duplicative internal reviews and clearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when a project works that should be expanded, our processes require teams to start fresh – telling communities to wait patiently while children grow, poverty deepens, untreated illnesses worsen, and the worn path to clean water is packed harder step, by step, by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, a World Bank project takes 27 months – on average – before a single dollar gets out the door. This is followed by a lengthy implementation process and project construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too often it’s longer than 10 years before the first benefits are felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must do better. And there is precious time we can save.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the entire process in our crosshairs, initially working to dramatically reduce the project review and approval time by one-third.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with ambition to do more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our plan calls for simplifying approvals, proportionately adjusting reviews, and combining intelligent technology with shorter timelines to drive speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we will do it without making a single change to our environmental and social standards that protect the communities we work for and give peace of mind to our partners and shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not believe quality conflicts with speed; we believe we can deliver both quality and speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is important progress but there’s more we can do and are developing a plan to better support governments with implementation. If we can build technical assistance into our projects from the start and help countries develop capacity – we can give time back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only are we streamlining our approach and encouraging our teams to work faster – we are exploring ways to incentivize speed and collaboration throughout the World Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "That need for collaboration, demand for impact, and belief that there is elegance in simplicity has inspired us to think about a potentially transformational program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hope is to refocus the World Bank to confront challenges not just as a funding mechanism, but as a knowledge mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s what governments are calling for – our knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank has long been celebrated for approaching the thorniest problems to find solutions and change lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my brief time at the Bank, I have seen that impact with my own eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In India, technology is used to track student attendance and performance in real time. Education experts spot problems, take quick action, and get kids back on track.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, student and teacher attendance, and enrollment have all increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Peru, free legal centers are changing – and saving – lives. Every day there are lines out the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women pursuing unpaid pensions and child support, others seeking justice for domestic and sexual violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stories that aren’t unique to women in Peru.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not just India and Peru that are trying to improve education outcomes or create more equitable societies. So, why haven’t we exported this success?\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank has enjoyed many successes. Knowledge gained with each.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last five years alone, we helped 100 million people find jobs, we expanded healthcare access to over 1 billion people, we’ve helped nearly 500 million kids get an education, and we’ve reduced carbon emissions by over 230 million tons annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "And despite this progress – too many still haven't felt the impact of what we have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too many are still unable to enjoy the dignity of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too many still live without access to electricity, quality education, decent health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "And too many of our most impactful projects go no further than a report on a shelf.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reverse the trend and extend the hand of good fortune further, we must scale and replicate the impactful solutions we have worked so hard to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we will do this in way that makes the World Bank more approachable, accessible, and understandable.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, bringing our knowledge to the forefront of our country driven model – and Country Partnership Frameworks. Sitting as partners with governments, working to craft a focused development plan that is a marriage of their ambition and our expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, helping to create and cultivate bankable projects and implement them. Our knowledge teams, working with our country teams to bring all the World Bank offers to bear – being a force multiplier for governments when additional capacity is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, driving thought leadership that moves the Bank, the world, and big ideas forward through our research, reports, and broader engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our knowledge work – the country partnership frameworks, cultivating bankable projects, and our thought leadership – will be organized into five simple verticals:\n",
      "\n",
      "People – health, education, social protection\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosperity – jobs, tax policy, economic policy, financial inclusion, small business\n",
      "\n",
      "Planet – air, water, soil health, biodiversity, forests, adaptation and mitigation\n",
      "\n",
      "Infrastructure – roads, bridges, energy\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital – because that’s transforming our world and will make everything else possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "And across those five verticals – holding our feet to the fire – we will measure our impact on gender equality, jobs for young people, and climate impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Embedded within the vault of the knowledge bank are our eight global challenges – Adaptation and Mitigation; Fragility and Conflict; Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness; Energy Access; Food and Nutrition Security; Water Security and Access; Enabling Digitalization; and Protecting Biodiversity and Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "All organized in a way that ensures impact at scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even with a better Bank. Even with governments, multilateral institutions, and philanthropies all working together we will still fall short.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need the scale, resources, and ingenuity of the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, IFC has worked with the private sector using just $5.6 billion of shareholder capital to mobilize $162 billion of private sector investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "But truly meaningful, sustainable progress has evaded us.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help solve this riddle, we launched the Private Sector Investment Lab and recruited fifteen of the world’s leading CEOs – across asset management companies, banks, as well as operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are exploring opportunities for the World Bank to help mitigate risk, drive policy actions to entice new entrants, and ensure projects become bankable.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are trying to make systemic change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lab is initially focused on increasing private investment in renewable energy and the energy transition in developing countries – searching for actionable ideas that will bend the curve on emissions heavy growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are already signs of hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first meeting, we identified a set of markets, each with potential for private capital investments, but each with challenges that we must address.\n",
      "\n",
      "We identified early ideas for how the Bank can better mobilize private finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those was to unify guarantee issuance across the institution, simplifying access to them and supporting an ambitious growth plan for MIGA over the next few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the strong demand for this effective tool, we are already acting and exploring ways to deliver.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are asking a lot of the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are asking them to operate in places and in situations that their algorithms and expertise may not extend, on roads the World Bank has traveled for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we are asking others to follow – we should be willing to share our map.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means giving private sector investors and rating agencies usable data from our Global Emerging Markets Risk Database, originally developed to inform our own investing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe transparency will inspire confidence and will lead to more informed decision making, risk taking, and ultimately investing in emerging markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our plan is to release this data in a matter of months.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are working now, in concert with other multilateral development banks, to reconstruct and clean the database to ensure its quality. This is a first step; we are continuing to explore what more we can do with our data to mobilize private capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "But our devotion is not just reflected in our words, it should be measured in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are becoming more efficient – incentivizing output, not input, and ensuring we focus less on money out the door and more on how many girls are in school, how many jobs are created, how many tons of carbon dioxide emissions are avoided, and how many private sector dollars are mobilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why we are reconstructing our corporate scorecard from the ground up. Pointing it toward outcomes and evidence – bringing it down from 153 items to around 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scorecard will be our yardstick of accountability and a guidepost that our teams can rally around and work toward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But by any measure, the World Bank is better today than it was yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a new vision and mission, we are asking all we can from our balance sheet, we are unleashing the potential of our Livable Planet Fund, and giving IDA the attention it deserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are becoming faster and more efficient; we have new ways to respond to crises, we are focusing our knowledge bank on scale, and driving thought leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are collaborating with partners to maximize impact, and we are working side-by-side with the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "And though we are making a difference, though we are evolving, though we are operating with urgency – our work has just begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambition of the Evolution Roadmap should not be the end of our ambition for the World Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though we don’t have all the answers now, and those we are working toward will take time, we do have desire, energy, and focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are new frontiers to explore – like moving from small, bespoke loans to large, standardized investments that can be packaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "If done right, we could draw in institutional investors – pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds – and put their $70 trillion to work in developing countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been the thing of fantasy for years, but hope isn’t a strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are in early days of building such a platform. But by doing the hard work now, we will be in a position later for success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Success that could be further multiplied across multilateral development banks to mobilize much greater amounts of private capital than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let us not forget, we aren’t starting at square one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, millions of people do their best to be part of the solution. There are real examples of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Nigeria, shopkeepers are using solar power to keep their shops open late into the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Indonesia, mangrove rehabilitation efforts are reducing carbon emissions, creating sustainable employment for women, and protecting communities from floods.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Vietnam, rice farmers are embracing new techniques that slash methane emissions, while increasing incomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not suffer from a shortage of solutions; we are paralyzed by a persistent lack of courage to pursue them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that we have solutions like these within reach, and resources at our disposal to scale them.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The audits come after an expose by The Reporters’ Collective (TRC) and Al Jazeera, which showed the bank’s employees had linked unauthorised mobile numbers to customer accounts that were missing a registered mobile number to onboard them on the bank’s new mobile banking app, bob World. These unauthorised mobile numbers were of bank staff, managers, guards, their relatives and bank agents in remote areas.\n",

      "\n",
      "In its nationwide audit, the Bank of Baroda verified documents of about 422,000 accounts that were suspected to be wrongfully registered on the app by the bank staff.

      "\n",
      "While final audit reports have duly pointed out discrepancies, indicating proper scrutiny at a higher level, these reports also establish the shoddy nature of the internal audit.\n",
      "\n",

      "The bank asked its internal auditors to mainly look for bob World request letters that show customers requested the online app service on their phones, and forms that customers signed to change mobile numbers linked with their accounts. The presence of these forms is proof that bank staff did not perform the fraudulent workaround to flog the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most of the cases, the documents were not found, audit reports accessed by TRC show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Serious gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Audit reports of eight regions found bob World request letters for barely one-third of the bank accounts under investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reports note that in many accounts that were signed up on bob World, the registered mobile number belonged to the respective branch, to the branch manager or to “business correspondents” – freelancers who operate as the bank’s agents and provide banking services in rural and remote areas through customer service points.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audit found that many accounts were linked with the mobile numbers of strangers. The bank has since instructed branches to immediately block mobile banking on such accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reports also found that in many accounts registered on bob World, unauthorised mobile numbers were linked and later removed from the back end. There are even instances wherein a customer provided one mobile number in the account-opening form but some other number was linked to his account and registered on bob World.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, while the bank’s policy states that one mobile number can be linked with eight bank accounts at most – only if all accounts are of the same family – the audit reports flag many instances of violation of this policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They list many mobile numbers, mostly those of business correspondents, linked with 10–60 accounts. One region’s report recommends that mobile numbers be unlinked from about one-fourth of the audited accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pan-India findings, too, seem to share these concerns. In a letter sent to all zonal and regional heads on August 10, Bank of Baroda’s Chief General Manager B Elango wrote: “The results of the audit have revealed that there are gaps with respect to the availability of basic essential documents and we cannot allow to continue with the gaps that were noticed.”\n",

      "He adds: “Looking at [the] seriousness of these findings, we have initiated the process to get the irregularities rectified as soon as possible.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Damage control\n",
      "\n",
      "While the bank has acknowledged the case of unauthorised debits and missing documents, evidence and anecdotes shared by employees suggest that some regional offices prodded their junior staff to forge these documents in an effort to salvage the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the cover-up tactics was to hurriedly add in the signatures and thumbprints of the bank customers on the mobile banking consent forms, many of which were arranged with a backdate – to enable the auditors to certify that all the documents were in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees from three states told TRC that at the branches they inspected or work at, these documents did not exist for many accounts and were fudged – in some cases, the signatures were forged and in others, the paperwork was done after the account had been registered on the app with branch staff going to account holders’ residences with the papers to obtain signatures ahead of the auditing.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRC has seen copies of such documents created for a few account holders from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, several documents from one branch in Uttar Pradesh had only the signatures of the account holder and no other details. The internal auditor who shared these forms with TRC said it was the branch staff that filled up the details, including the crucial ones such as the mobile number and the date of the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "This auditor said his regional manager, in a video conference, had asked all the auditors to “cooperate” with the branch staff and strive to certify that all accounts are OK. Because of such instructions, the auditor said he approved even the forms he knew were freshly obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "From another bank branch in Uttar Pradesh and one in Gujarat, TRC saw copies of audited forms with customers’ thumbprints on them instead of signatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank employees who shared these forms said they do not know how these farmers, who cannot even sign their names, could use a mobile banking app. The employees said thumbprints were obtained on these forms just ahead of the auditing, and the branch staff filled in these forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audit reports viewed by TRC also highlight that many illiterate customers were registered on bob World. Many of them were registered through a business correspondent’s mobile number linked to their account.\n",
      "\n",
      "One audit report flagged that illiterate customers are not eligible for the app. Similarly, children under the age of 15 are also not eligible, but many minors’ accounts have been registered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the accounts under scrutiny for app enrolment were opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. This scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to link the poor to the banking system by waiving minimum balance requirements and paying subsidies into their accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bank employee said he and his colleagues used pressure tactics to get these customers to sign the forms. He said the staff told customers they needed to sign the documents urgently to update account details, or else the accounts could get closed or the subsidy could stop. They were kept in the dark about bob World auditing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This employee highlighted another anomaly. Auditors had been asked to verify account-opening forms, too, as these would have the customer’s mobile number, but many accounts did not have those forms. So, along with the other documents, some branch staff obtained customers’ signatures/thumbprints on these forms, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since employees of this branch did not want to risk inviting scrutiny by higher-ups on why they had been backdating these forms – even though those were their oral instructions – they either left the date blank or entered the date of the auditing on some of the freshly obtained forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, these account-opening forms show the date of opening the account as July 29 or 30 (the dates of the auditing), even though these accounts have existed for at least a couple of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audit reports seen by TRC show that this workaround was followed fairly commonly.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reports not only highlight discrepancies, but also establish the shoddy nature of the internal audit. These reports are littered with remarks about customers’ documents that are unfilled, partially filled, unsigned, undated, unverified or invalid for other reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a fair audit at the branch level, such documents would have been rejected, say experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red flags\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarded as a pioneer of forensic accounting in India, Certified Bank Forensic Accountant Mayur Joshi told TRC that in auditing, investigators ought to watch out for inconsistencies, such as a new, crisp form bearing an old date; or a new format of form bearing an old date.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said there are auditing firms that specialise in the kind of document verification for which Bank of Baroda engaged its branch staff. He said the bank should have hired an external auditor for this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certified Fraud Examiner Nikhil Parulkar, who has two decades of experience in the banking and consulting industries, said the gravity of the allegations warranted an independent and impartial audit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you ask a branch manager to conduct an audit when that’s outside his scope of work? Is he a competent authority to conduct audits?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "If customers’ documents have indeed been procured and manipulated as described, it is an unhealthy and predatory practice, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joshi said freshly obtained forms and backdated forms are perceived as red flags in the world of auditing. He said the very need to obtain basic documents anew is a serious issue since it indicates the bank did not have these documents, which violates the RBI’s directions and can incur a penalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number game\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 25, two weeks after TRC and Al Jazeera published the expose, a regional office in the Bhopal zone sent to its branches an email bearing the subject line: “URGENT REMINDER: Staff Mobile Number entered in Customers Accounts”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening line of the email reads: “We refer to the captioned subject and share the list of customer ids having mobile numbers of staff and Bank’s CUG [Closed User Group] number seeded in customer’s accounts and subsequently, bob World is activated using such mobile numbers.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The ban, which covered items such as rice, cement and poultry, was imposed as part of the unorthodox policies under former central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele in an effort to prop up the naira currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lifting of the ban will cheer analysts and investors who had been warning that the restriction showed the central bank was still maintaining some form of capital controls.\n",
      "\n",

      "Africa's largest economy has struggled to get to grips with chronic dollar shortages on the official market, where trading volumes have steadily declined, causing the naira to slump to a record low against the dollar, with a 37% premium over the official exchange rate in street trading on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As part of its responsibility to ensure price stability, the CBN will boost liquidity in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market by interventions from time to time,\" central bank spokesperson Isa Abdulmumin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As market liquidity improves, these CBN interventions will gradually decrease,\" he said in a statement.\n",

      "\n",
      "The latest measures announced by the central bank are \"another market-friendly step\" to unify the exchange rates and ease pressure on the naira in the parallel market, where importers of the 43 items had to access dollars, said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy at U.K. based FIM Partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is still more to do. To reduce forex shortages in the official market, the CBN might also need to signal that commercial banks can offer a weaker naira rate for dollars, to help increase the supply of dollars,\" Robertson said.\n",

      "As we gather for these Annual Meetings – for the first time in 50 years on the African continent – we are aware of two realities. On the one hand, the global economy remains in a better place than many predicted, with growth outperforming expectations, and annual headline inflation falling in many of the major economies, including the United States. At the same time, the global economy faces significant uncertainty. Major shocks emanating from global challenges—the economic disruption from COVID-19; catastrophic, climate change-driven extreme weather events; and fragility and conflict in all parts of the world—have eroded development gains and disproportionately impacted the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries. Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable war of aggression against Ukraine has caused a tragic loss of life, destruction of property, and has exacerbated global economic challenges by destabilizing energy and food prices. We call on Russia to swiftly end this unjust war, which would help to rapidly reverse some of these trends and set the global economy on a more positive trajectory. The compounding effects of these shocks have taken a terrible toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods disrupted, and contributed to rising extreme poverty, hunger, and slower economic growth. Further, their impacts have been more severe across emerging markets and developing countries, often in those countries that are already burdened by heightened debt vulnerabilities and have the least fiscal space to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have undertaken important efforts over the last year to evolve the multilateral development banks (MDBs), starting with the World Bank, to better address global challenges, particularly climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. Addressing such challenges is in the national interest of all countries; mitigates risks to our collective economic outlook; and is integral to achieving poverty reduction and sustainable, inclusive, and resilient development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States is not alone in this undertaking. Beginning with the Development Committee last year at the Annual Meetings, there has been a broad coalition calling for bold and urgent evolution reforms. In the G20, the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, the Africa Climate Summit, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit, the international community has also loudly and collectively voiced the importance of MDB evolution. Through these fora we have all recognized that addressing global challenges and achieving poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth are mutually reinforcing, and we must all work together to build an MDB system better equipped to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past year, shareholders and World Bank Management have worked together to advance the reforms that will enable the Bank to evolve to bring 21st century solutions to 21st century challenges. We have updated the Bank’s vision and mission to reflect that addressing global challenges is a core part of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The Bank’s updated operational model will integrate global challenges through refocused diagnostics, enhanced country engagement, and greater support to sub-national entities. It will also deliver a concessionality framework that will enable greater support to address global challenges. Reforms to the IBRD financial model endorsed in the spring will yield around $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next 10 years, with more possible in the near term given the establishment of the Portfolio Guarantee Platform and work to issue hybrid capital to interested shareholders. This is just one part of the initial $200 billion in additional financial capacity we expect to achieve over the next decade across the MDB system through the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review recommendations that have been adopted or are under consideration. The energy behind the evolution work has sparked similar efforts at the regional development banks, which together with the World Bank, will make the entire system deliver better.\n",
      "\n",
      "These accomplishments are significant. But our work is far from done. It is crucial that the World Bank robustly implement the evolution reforms that have been adopted, complete work on those currently underway—like the concessionality framework and measures to increase speed and agility—and begin work on reforms that have not yet been taken up. Specifically, we urge the World Bank to establish incentives for staff to incorporate addressing global challenges into country engagement, and fully implement the recommendations of the G20 MDB CAF Report, including the recommendation to incorporate a prudent share of callable capital in the Bank’s capital adequacy framework. We also call on the World Bank to implement private capital mobilization (PCM) reforms that include incentives for staff to mobilize private capital rather than use own-account financing, ambitious portfolio-wide mobilization targets, clear reporting on results, and improved quality and accessibility of data in the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database. The World Bank – and other MDBs – should develop scalable platforms to increase private investment, including securitization platforms, and they should scale and better utilize guarantees, insurance, local currency lending, and other de-risking tools to crowd-in investors. We look forward to ideas from President Banga’s new Private Sector Innovation Lab on how all parts of the World Bank can step up efforts in these areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, these reforms across vision and mission; the operating model; and financial capacity will build a better bank that delivers both more finance and greater impact. And a strong and effective World Bank that is open and eager to partner with others is vital to having a strong and effective IFI system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In support of the evolution agenda, President Biden requested funding from Congress to contribute to the new Portfolio Guarantee Platform and the Global Public Goods (GPG) Fund. This funding would unlock roughly $25 billion in new IBRD lending capacity, the terms of which could be bought down with the GPG Fund contribution to incentivize investments that address priority global challenges. Evolution will not succeed, however, without sufficient attention to the immediate needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries, that endure the harshest impact of global challenges and are least equipped to cope with them. This is why President Biden also requested $1 billion for IDA’s Enhanced Crisis Response Window (CRW+). We appreciate those who have joined us in boosting the concessional finance capacity of the World Bank and invite others to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the largest contributor to IDA-20, protecting the resources that go to these countries is a top priority of the United States. This is why we strongly support efforts by IDA management to responsibly boost IDA’s capacity using existing resources, in addition to our own potential contribution to the CRW+, and we look forward to a successful IDA-21 replenishment next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We welcome the efforts of the World Bank and other MDBs to drive food system transformation and strengthen food security through medium and long-term investment, policy reforms, and technical assistance, including through the IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity launched last year. Coordination plays a key role, and we are actively working with the MDBs to institutionalize the coherent approach fostered by the Action Plan, and applying lessons learned to future work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building resilience to shocks arising from global challenges is critical, which is why we must press forward with policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The World Bank and other MDBs are key providers of public climate finance, mobilizers of private finance towards emissions mitigation and climate change adaptation, and supporters of innovative financing tools that accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The World Bank should screen all projects for cost-effective climate benefits, particularly to build resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change. It is also critical that climate finance be targeted efficiently, and we urge alignment of global financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement and investment standards that incorporate transparency and accountability. World Bank Country Climate and Development reports should serve a standard-setting function, helping countries advance their climate agendas by informing the design of the International Financial Institutions’ projects and programs, including specific and ambitious reforms for the country to implement. Mobilizing the private sector is also instrumental to achieve progress towards our collective climate ambition. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) are a promising model for mobilizing and aligning public, private, and philanthropic capital for the energy infrastructure and social investments needed to accelerate the transition towards a cleaner energy future in ways that benefit all communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that the climate finance architecture is complex and developing countries can struggle to access available financing. While an important source of financing, including much needed concessional financing, the climate finance architecture is not optimized to help countries access finance easily or to deliver finance at scale where the need is greatest or where the impact will be highest. This is why the United States, working closely with partners, including the incoming G20 and G7 presidencies, is initiating an effort to review the climate finance architecture, with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. As an implementing entity and host to some of the largest climate investment funds, the World Bank has an important role to play. We call on the World Bank to assess how it can do a better job in helping countries access climate finance and help them to blend concessional resources from the specialized climate and environment funds with the Bank’s own resources. By partnering with others, the World Bank strengthens the overall architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enormous infrastructure gap in developing countries and emerging markets continues to hold back economic growth, the delivery of basic services, and trade. We must do more to maximize the capabilities of the World Bank to support infrastructure development, including in the energy, transportation, health, digital, and critical minerals arenas. Doing so will require stepped up efforts on project preparation and structuring—including scaling up the Global Infrastructure Facility—increasing access to knowledge and data, and assisting the implementation of policy reforms to create a more inviting environment for private investment. The United States and its partners are proud to be focusing on significantly scaling up private capital mobilization to help close the infrastructure gap, including as a core component of the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI). Under PGI, the G7 is prioritizing strengthening supply chains, especially for critical minerals, with the creation of the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it is evident that threats to global health can disrupt entire societies and the global economy. That is why the United States remains committed to improving regional and global health security, and our contribution to the Pandemic Fund will catalyze investments to fill critical gaps in pandemic preparedness and bolster overall health security. Recognizing the continuing risk of pandemic spillover, the World Bank should incorporate health-related risks and vulnerabilities, including an assessment for country pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response capacities, into its current work. The World Bank will also need to coordinate with partners and with other efforts underway to strengthen the global health architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade, violent conflict has spiked, causing immense human suffering, contributing to extreme poverty and to the significant displacement of people, while also stunting economic growth and absorbing a large share of national budgets. We need strong collective action to mitigate the widespread impact of greater fragility and forced displacement. The United States is committed to strengthening global resiliency and democratic renewal, and promoting peaceful, self-reliant nations that become strong economic and security partners capable of addressing shared challenges. As part of the evolution initiative, and learning from the mid-term review of the Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence, we welcome the World Bank integrating new diagnostics, incentives, and approaches into its operations that address the root causes and impacts of fragility, conflict, and violence to help build countries’ resilience to potential fragility drivers within the country and spillovers from neighboring countries. We urge the World Bank to redouble efforts to anchor and leverage strategic partnerships with peer institutions, civil society, and the private sector to strengthen its ability to respond with agility and impact in fragile contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States strongly supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the bold action needed to address global challenges that threaten to set back progress on achieving the SDGs. The World Bank has made good progress with the Gender Strategy Update, and the Equality of Opportunity for Sexual Gender Minorities report, but it can do more to combat discriminatory laws and policies, along with their economic impacts, social and cultural norms around economic roles and responsibilities, and gender-based violence in its programming. These considerations should be front and center as the World Bank assesses business and investment climates worldwide through the B-Ready report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accountability and transparency in the multilateral institutions is essential for MDB projects to be successful, and for greater development impact and effectiveness. This is why the United States will continue to press for greater access to, and disclosure of, information; stronger environmental and social safeguards, and robust governance; a culture of learning and accountability; and transparent and competitive procurement practices that are consistent with sustainable development. We look forward to upcoming reviews that will bolster the World Bank’s sustainability, environmental and social framework, and accountability mechanisms. The World Bank must continue to strengthen its approach to avoiding, reducing and mitigating harm in its projects. Finally, corruption disproportionately hurts the poorest, undermining the World Bank’s ability to eliminate extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity, and build resilience. There must be a culture of compliance across all levels of the Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we work towards a better World Bank that is fit for 21st century challenges, we recognize the efforts undertaken by World Bank President Ajay Banga, senior management, and the thousands of staff who have tirelessly worked towards this goal. We are grateful for their energy, creativity, dedication, and collaborative spirit. They represent multilateralism at is best – collective work to meet the world’s most critical needs and to meet the moment with great impact.\n",

      "HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China is responding. Economists and fund managers have been lobbying for Beijing to buy stocks directly to prop up the country’s equity markets which has been slammed by outflows. The call was partly answered on Wednesday evening by Central Huijin Investment, though not quite in the way it was hoped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state fund boosted its controlling stakes in the Big Four lenders by just a few basis points. It spent a 477 million yuan ($65 million) on Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), (1398.HK), China Construction Bank (601939.SS), (0939.HK) and Bank of China (601988.SS), (3988.HK), and Agricultural Bank of China (601288.SS), (1288.HK). It’s a tiny amount but Central Huijin said it plans to keep adding over the next six months to its holdings already worth 2.5 trillion yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Graphics\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a stablisation fund of dreams. Huijin’s latest move is dwarfed by Beijing’s effort in 2015 to avert a market meltdown, when the state fund spent some 20 billion yuan - about $3 billion at current exchange rates - to acquire banking shares owned by other state entities, and freed up capital for the latter to mop up billions worth of mainland-traded shares. That intervention ultimately failed to improve sentiment especially among foreign investors and preceded a record $725 billion net capital outflows in 2016, per Institute of International Finance. Indeed, Central Huijin has refrained from imposing itself on the stock market as frequently as it did between 2008 and 2013, when it raised its stakes in the lenders multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the market cheered with the Big Four lenders gaining as much as 6% in Hong Kong on Thursday. China’s banks have been bracing for the impact of unresolved debt problems in property and local government financing vehicles that pose a systematic financial risk to the world’s second largest economy. That’s one reason Chinese banks on average trade at barely half book value, compared to more than par before 2015 when there was also a housing crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing’s latest cautious move looks designed not to spook the market as it did before and may signal the start of something prudent if lenders start to properly recognise soured loans and require recapitalising. That recognition of the problem would be the logical and most sensible end point of President Xi Jinping’s deleveraging campaign. By helping the group attain a richer value, the government could also ultimately reduce its own pain.\n",

      "A further 30% of banks - including some of the world's largest - would be vulnerable if the global economy enters a period of low growth and high inflation, or \"stagflation,\" the IMF also said in its semi-annual Global Financial Stability Report.\n",

      "The warning was based on a new, tougher global stress test that the IMF applied to around 900 lenders in 29 countries following the collapse earlier this year of California-based Silicon Valley Bank, Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group and two other U.S. lenders.\n",

      "The IMF adjusted this year's stress test to probe the impact of its baseline economic scenario of higher interest rates for longer, as well as the possibility of consumers yanking deposits. Its \"severe-but-plausible\" scenario envisages the global economy entering \"stagflation.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The U.S. central bank held its benchmark overnight interest rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range last month, but signaled one more quarter-percentage-point hike would likely be needed before the end of this year to cement inflation's downward path, and that the policy rate would probably end 2024 above 5%.\n",

      "MARRAKECH, Morocco, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Thursday hailed progress on a long-awaited memorandum on Zambia's debt restructuring, and said consensus was growing on thorny issues such as the comparability of treatment of private and public creditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters the Group of 20 Common Framework for debt restructuring had been slow to deliver results, but welcomed the acceleration of timelines in recent individual country cases, including Zambia.\n",
      "\n",
      "News about Zambia's imminent deal with its official creditors emerged during a panel on debt at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zambia Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane, speaking on the same panel as Georgieva, said it has been \"embarrassing to find ourselves in debt distress,\" which forced the country to cancel infrastructure projects it could no longer afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Georgieva also said she was more optimistic about the debt restructuring process now than before the creation of the Common Framework, but said more progress was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We should be concerned, but recognize that we are not at the footsteps of a debt crisis,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throwing out the Common Framework altogether would put the world in a \"much less predictable environment,\" she told a news conference earlier in the day, adding that creative approaches were also needed, including moves to better align debt restructuring with the climate crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "A progress report on the debt restructuring discussions, published Thursday by the IMF, World Bank and India, the G20's current chair, found \"significant progress\" on actual debt restructuring cases, but said private and public creditors still had differences on the comparability of treatment issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Assessing and enforcing comparability of treatment (CoT) between official bilateral and private creditors remains a divisive issue and no consensus could be reached among all stakeholders,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable met on Thursday, bringing together senior finance officials from the United States, China and other G20 countries, along with Zambia and other debtor nations, private sector creditors and the IMF and World Bank for closed-door talks on debt issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zambia became the first African country to default in the COVID-19 pandemic era in 2020 but its restructuring under the G20's Common Framework process was plagued with delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "It clinched an agreement in June to restructure $6.3 billion in debt owed to governments abroad including China and members of the Paris Club of creditor nations, but a formal memorandum of understanding (MoU) has taken months to complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two sources familiar with the process said the negotiations took time but ultimately yielded a first: detailed language agreed by major creditor China with the Paris Club on how to enforce the comparability of treatment of private and public creditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If indeed a better deal can be reached with the private creditors, then the deal with the official creditors is just off the table,\" one of the sources said. \"That is the first time ever that China and the Paris Club have generated joint rules.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress in Zambia's case ould provide a model for subsequent debt restructuring agreements, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "China has said that its agreement with Zambia is not a blueprint, but the metrics to assess comparability and how to enforce it would create some precedent, the sources said.\n",

      "WELLINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - New Zealand's consumer inflation slowed to a two-year low in the third quarter, reducing expectations that the central bank will hike the cash rate further in November and prompting a fall in the New Zealand dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer prices rose 5.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, slower than the 6.0% increase in the second quarter, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement on Tuesday. The data was slightly lower than economists' expectations of a 5.9% annual rise in a Reuters poll.\n",
      "\n",
      "While inflation remains well above the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) target of 1% to 3%, the reduced inflationary pressures has made an interest rate hike less likely at the central bank's policy meeting in November, according to the market and analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-year swap rates fell 5 basis points to 5.61% as the market pared the chance of a hike in November to 20% from 33% before the data. The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.4% to $0.5905 following the data.\n",

      "\"Overall, the RBNZ will be comforted by this combination of results. That said, they are probably still nervous on the\n",

      "\"We think the RBNZ will be happy to sit on their hands in November and see how the economy and inflation evolves through the summer period.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation is a significant challenge for the RBNZ and it has responded by raising interest rates to 5.5% from a record low of 0.25% in October 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central bank has said rate increases are having the desired impact on dampening inflation, although the cash rate will have to remain at this restrictive level for some time to ensure inflation returns to the target range.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a speech on tokenisation, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Brad Jones said a key priority for the bank was assessing how different forms of digital money and infrastructure could support the development of tokenised asset markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Australia's government on Monday separately outlined proposals for regulating crypto and digital assets that will make platforms subject to existing Australian financial services laws and require platform operators to obtain an Australian Financial Services Licence.\n",

      "This will include minimum standards for holding tokens, standards for custody software and standards when transacting in tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jones, who heads the RBA's financial system division, said tokenisation could deliver hypothetical transaction savings of around A$13 billion ($8.20 billion) a year to issuers in Australia's capital markets, in part through providing increased liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another A$1 billion to A$4 billion could be saved in transaction fees via increased trading volumes and the benefits of atomic settlement, particularly on cross-border payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atomic settlement is instantaneous swapping of an asset for a payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBA has been studying whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) of its own and if it would help facilitate atomic settlement in tokenised asset markets.\n",

      "Consumers are taking longer mortgages and spending more on credit cards in an attempt to adapt to higher interest rates and living costs, potentially storing up debt troubles in future, the Bank of England has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central bank’s financial policy committee (FPC), which keeps tabs on the health of the UK financial system, has seen evidence over the last three months of some households increasingly relying on credit cards to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer spending was under pressure as higher borrowing costs, due to the continued rise in interest rates, and cost of living pressures meant many were having to find other ways to pay for everyday purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the annual rate of credit card spending growth was relatively stable – holding steady at 11.8% – the committee said the trend “could lead to greater debt vulnerability for households in the near term”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospective homebuyers have also been adapting to financial pressures by taking out longer-term mortgages. In total, the proportion of mortgages lasting 35 years or more had increased from 4% in the first three months of the year to 12% in the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK has a relatively short-term mortgage market compared with some countries, including the US, where the average mortgage term is 23.3 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While longer mortgage terms and other forbearance measures could reduce pressures on borrowers in the short term, they could increase debt burdens over the long term,” the committee said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FPC also noted an increase in borrowers falling into arrears – albeit from low levels – and expected the number of customers falling behind on their debts to increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks had simultaneously started to tighten their lending, amid fears over the economic outlook. But overall, the UK banking system was broadly in good health and asset quality remained “relatively stable”, the FPC said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it said the potential risks were “somewhat” offset by rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which require banks to be responsible lenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Bank announced it would pause its normal stress tests, which ensure that the UK’s largest high street lenders can withstand severe financial shocks and an extreme downturn in the UK and global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, it would run a “desk-based scenario” – similar to checks conducted during the Covid crisis – which would measure the health of the banking system as a whole, without having to publish the results of individual lenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The committee said this would allow it to test banks’ balance sheets against more than one scenario, including whether interest rates stayed higher for longer, or suddenly dropped and affected banks’ incomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would also give policymakers an opportunity to review the normal stress-testing regime, which was implemented after the financial crisis and could end up including a broader range of lenders, including smaller banks.\n",

      "Separately, on Tuesday, an International Monetary Fund global stress test found that up to 30% of 900 banks across 29 countries would be vulnerable in the event of a prolonged period of stagflation – when growth is weak and prices are rapidly rising.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the FPC called for stricter rules on how quickly money market funds, which invest solely in cash or cash equivalents like government and short-term corporate bonds, could sell off their assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The call follows the panic sparked by the dash for cash at the start of the pandemic in 2020, which resulted in investors pulling their money at speed, as well as the UK’s pension fund crisis in September 2022 that was originally prompted by the government’s disastrous mini-budget, but caused UK bond prices to plunge at a record rate.\n",

      "We express our deepest condolences to the victims and their families affected by the earthquakes in Morocco and Afghanistan as well as the floods in Libya. We are committed to providing necessary assistance. We hope that the successful World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakech will accelerate Morocco’s strong recovery from the disaster. We unequivocally condemn the recent terror attacks by Hamas on the State of Israel and express our solidarity with the Israeli people. We reiterate our unwavering support for Ukraine and are united in our condemnation of Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Russia’s war has caused tragic loss of life, destruction of property and infrastructure, increased global food insecurity, and exacerbated global economic challenges. We remain determined to foster international cooperation to address the global economic hardships caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine and its weaponization of food and energy. In this context, we urge Russia to end its attacks on Ukrainian grain supplies and infrastructure and to expeditiously restore the Black Sea Grain Initiative to improve supply to the global market and reduce food price volatility. We call on Russia to immediately end its illegal war against Ukraine, which would clear one of the biggest uncertainties over the global economic outlook. We will continue our efforts to ensure that Russia pays for the long-term reconstruction of Ukraine. We will also explore all possible avenues to aid Ukraine, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. We welcome the initial effort by the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force to account for Russia’s sovereign assets immobilized and held in REPO member jurisdictions which is at this stage estimated at around USD 280 billion and expect the REPO Task Force to refine this initial effort over the coming months. We recall and reaffirm our Leaders’ Statement that, consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. We reiterate our unwavering resolve to impose and enforce sanctions and other economic measures to further undermine Russia’s capacity to wage its illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression. We remain committed to countering any attempts to evade and undermine our sanction measures. We will continue to strengthen coordination in monitoring cross-border transactions between Russia and other countries, take further action directed at the Russian financial sector as necessary, and closely monitor the effectiveness of the price caps on Russian crude oil and petroleum products to ensure the measure delivers on its objectives, and take any necessary and appropriate enforcement actions required. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. We remain strongly committed to supporting Ukraine’s urgent short-term financing needs, as well as assisting its neighboring and other severely affected countries. Building on the successful completion of the first review of the IMF program for Ukraine, and looking ahead to the second review, we will continue our joint efforts to help address Ukraine's 2024 financing needs. We look forward to continued implementation of structural reforms by Ukraine and successful completion of the upcoming reviews, which will promote macroeconomic and financial stabilization, enhance governance and strengthen institutions, contribute to longer-term economic sustainability and post-war reconstruction. We will continue to support Ukraine’s repair of its critical infrastructure, recovery and reconstruction, including through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine. We will explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, where those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations towards Russia under applicable laws, could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with applicable laws. We welcome the successful launch of the “Partnership for RISE (Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement)” in collaboration with the WBG. This was achieved through financial and other contributions from G7 members, non-G7 countries and international organizations, and we call on more interested parties to join this important initiative. RISE aims to support low- and middle-income countries in playing bigger roles in the midstream and downstream in supply chains of clean energy products. Diversifying supply chains can contribute to safeguarding energy security, supporting macroeconomic stability and resilience, strengthening capacity-building, and achieving net zero. We continue to support the implementation of RISE with speed and quality, including through pilot local information platforms to share relevant on-the-ground information and identify issues to be addressed by RISE. We will continue to coordinate on further enhancing supply chain resilience. We reiterate our commitment to supporting emerging market and developing economies, particularly low-income countries, in dealing with multiple and complex challenges including climate change and food insecurity. In doing so, we recognize the important role of public finance in leveraging private capital through multilateral and bilateral initiatives. We also recognize the importance of improving business environments to attract more private investment in recipient countries and of supporting the mobilization of domestic resources. We welcome the strategy developed by the OECD to expand and deepen its outreach with non-OECD members, to support them in attracting more, better, and safe FDI. We also support the OECD’s Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA). The G7-Africa Ministerial Roundtable to be held on 14 October 2023 builds on last year’s successful meeting and offers an opportunity for Finance Ministers of G7 members and the G20 Presidency to discuss with Finance Ministers of African countries how to further mobilize financing to Africa. We remain committed to further strengthening financial and economic collaboration and political dialogue with African countries and other emerging market and developing economies. We reiterate our firm commitment to support progress of the G20’s discussion on key issues such as debt, MDB evolution, robust and sustainable PRGT, and IMF quota review. We continue to support the G20’s efforts to step up the implementation of the Common Framework in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. We call for the finalization of the MOU on the debt treatment for Zambia as quickly as possible and swift agreements on debt treatments for Ghana and Ethiopia. We welcome significant progress at the official creditor committee towards agreement on debt treatment for Sri Lanka and look forward to its swift resolution. We welcome efforts to explore the integration of Climate-Resilient Debt Clauses in lending instruments and encourage more creditors to offer these. While welcoming the initial progress shown in the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review Roadmap with a potential additional lending headroom of at least USD 200 billion over the next decade, we urge MDBs to continue their steadfast efforts to further implement the CAF recommendations. For the WBG, we will deliver on the G20 Leaders’ commitment to collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank’s capacity to support low and middle-income countries that need help in addressing global challenges, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. We will also play a proactive role and work closely with other shareholders in agreeing on a clear framework for allocating scarce concessional resources in a well-targeted and well-prioritized manner with a view to safeguarding global public goods, while continuing to prioritize the needs of the poorest countries. We will decide on the best options to contribute to these initiatives. We are committed to collectively securing an ambitious IDA 21 replenishment next year to support low-income countries. At the IMF, we also support the work to ensure the PRGT is on a sustainable footing to meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We continue our utmost efforts to ensure a swift and timely conclusion of the 16th General Review of Quotas of the IMF with a quota increase agreed by 15 December 2023. We reaffirm our May 2017 exchange rate commitments. We look forward to an ambitious replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) resources at the end of the year.\n",

      "\n",
      "A project to build a facility described as \"the world's largest offshore wind farm\" took a big step forward this month by producing its first power. Located in the North Sea, over 130 kilometers off England's northeast coast, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm still has some way to go before it's fully operational, but the installation and powering up of its first turbine is a major feat in itself. That's because GE Vernova's Haliade-X turbines stand 260 meters tall — that's higher than San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge — and have blades measuring 107 meters. Turbine installation at Dogger Bank has required a huge amount of planning and preparation, with the Voltaire — a specialist vessel designed and built by the family-owned Jan De Nul Group — playing a key role. With a lifting capacity of 3,200 metric tons, the Voltaire — named after the 18th-century French philosopher — will have installed a total of 277 Haliade-X turbines when its work is complete.\n",

      "\n",
      "Described by Dogger Bank as the \"largest offshore jack-up installation vessel ever built,\" in many ways, it's the pinnacle of an extensive supply chain involving numerous businesses and stakeholders. The logistics are complex and multi-layered, with water depth a particular issue. The sea in the Dogger Bank Offshore Development Zone is up to 63 meters deep, meaning the Voltaire's ability to work in deeper waters is crucial. This is where its four legs come into play. According to Jan De Nul, the legs of the Voltaire — which was built at the COSCO Shipping Shipyard in China — enable it to lift itself above the water's surface. With each leg measuring roughly 130 meters in length, they highlight the scale of equipment required to install huge offshore wind turbines like GE's Haliade-X. In an online Q&A before installations at Dogger Bank began, Jan De Nul's Rutger Standaert spoke of their importance. \"Thanks to those legs, the Voltaire can effectively operate at a water depth of 80 meters,\" Standaert, who is manager of vessel construction at the business, said. He noted that the Voltaire's capabilities would enable installations further out to sea, allowing it to play a key role in the emerging floating offshore wind sector. \"Off the Scottish coast, for example, expensive floating windfarms are often the only way to tap into offshore wind,\" he said. \"The water is too deep for fixed windfarms, but the Voltaire can offer new opportunities.\" Thinking big Once completed, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm will have a total capacity of 3.6 gigawatts (GW) and be able to power as many as six million homes per year, according to its developers. Work on the project is taking place over three phases: Dogger Bank A, B, and C. A fourth phase of the wind farm known as Dogger Bank D has also been proposed, and would increase its capacity even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Søren Lassen is head of offshore wind research at Wood Mackenzie, a research and consultancy group. He described Dogger Bank as \"a huge project, especially if you combine the three phases.\" \"It is a project that requires a lot of preparation,\" he told CNBC. \"There's the logistics in terms of having the vessels to do the installation ... and then of course, you also have the logistics in terms of getting the components to the marshaling port.\" Both of these aspects were being made \"a lot more complicated\" by the use of next-generation turbines and a next-generation installation vessel, Lassen said. \"You have ... a lot of innovation that goes into this. And not only do you need a new vessel or new components, you also need new factories to build those components.\" As such, a slew of upgrades and adjustments were needed to \"reverberate throughout the entire value chain\" for operations to run smoothly, he added. Bigger turbines, bigger challenges?\n",

      "Thanks to their sheer size, larger turbine designs have created a specific set of needs for the offshore wind sector and sites like the Dogger Bank Wind Farm. \"From cranes to vessels, we use a number of specially designed pieces of equipment to transport the Haliade-X turbines that will be used in this project,\" a spokesperson for GE Offshore Wind said in a statement sent to CNBC. Wood Mackenzie's Lassen stressed the importance of having dedicated transportation vessels, noting that the towers of turbines need to be broken into three or four sections in order to fit on board. Massive blades represent the biggest challenge, he said, as they have to be laid flat. \"And that just means that you need a very, very long transportation vessel, [and] that you need to stack them up accordingly.\"\n",

      "BEIJING — An ambassador of an African country to China has criticized the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for restrictive lending policies. \"The problem is that the ratings we are making for the African [countries] should be different,\" Ibrahima Sory Sylla, ambassador for the West African country of Senegal, said Thursday at an event at Peking University. He said ratings from Fitch or Standard and Poor's don't take into account local factors such as food security — but they are the basis for IMF and World Bank assessments of economic sustainability. The number of people in West Africa experiencing an acute lack of food surged by nearly 40% in a year, according to a Reuters report in December citing the United Nation's World Food Programme. The figure surged 60% during that time for the number of East Africans, the report said. Senegal significantly increased its borrowing from China in 2021 and 2022, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa database managed by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.\n",

      "While that reflected a spike in West African borrowing, such loan activity was more muted in other parts of Africa — reversing a growth trend of the last 20 years, the data showed. \"What we can understand is that so many [multilateral development banks] through the G20 [debt] suspension initiative, they said you have to go through this initiative, but when you [do so], they suddenly decided to downgrade your risk,\" Senegal's Sylla said. \"And most of the developed countries, the Western countries, they can go beyond to 200% of the ratio between the debt and the GDP. Their rating is not downgraded.\" The IMF, World Bank and S&P did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A Fitch Ratings spokesperson told CNBC all its sovereign rating decisions are \"taken solely in accordance with one globally consistent and publicly available rating criteria.\" \"Rating decisions are based on independent, robust, transparent and timely analysis,\" the person added.\n",

Thia said he just returned from a trip to Africa two weeks ago and saw a \"brand-new city\" being built by many Chinese contractors — but with very low occupancy. \"That makes me very worried,\" he said, declining to name the specific African country. \"The loan itself matters, infrastructure matters, but timing and debt management and absorption capacity matters, coordinating and staggering out and having a plan,\" said the AIIB economist. \"Build slowly, get people in, build more, is sometimes much more efficient, maybe not as big [a] bang.\"\n",

From 2000 to 2020, China loaned $160 billion to African countries, according to a report released Thursday by Peking University's Institute of New Structural Economics. The research claimed every 1% increase in Chinese loans resulted in an increase of 0.176% in African economic growth. Allan Joseph Chintedza, ambassador of Malawi to China, said the report should look also at the repayment period for Chinese loans. \"The gesture and what the [Belt and Road Initiative] is trying to do is perfect. It would be very sad if we actually lost out because we are not addressing some of the key issues that we need to address that you gave,\" Chintedza said, without specifying. The East African country needs to provide a \"sustainability letter\" from the Chinese government in order to borrow more from the IMF, Chintedza added. \"Instead of us concentrating on implementing these agent programs, we are caught in between negotiations of trying to raise [funds], to improve or at least justify the debts that we have.\" \"I think the majority of the loans has to be extended because that's the only way we can be given breathing space to be able to meet the requirements but also to invest in the social sense,\" he said.\n",

      "MARRAKECH, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are planning a springtime push to cut interest payments made to commercial banks, in part to recoup some of the costs associated with a decade worth of stimulus, sources familiar with discussions said.\n",
      "\n",
      "With banks now earning generous profits, in great part at the expense of the central bank and the taxpayer, policymakers have already cut to zero the rate they pay to lenders on a certain pool of their excess deposits kept at the ECB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some policymakers have also been pushing for an increase in that asset pool, known as the minimum reserve ratio and roughly equivalent to 1% of deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "That would mean overall interest payments to lenders - which still earn the ECB deposit rate, currently 4%, on other excess cash parked with the central bank - would be reduced further. But the ECB rejected the proposal in July, partly on resistance from its Executive Board, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the battle is not over and proponents are looking to make a fresh push to raise the ratio next spring, when the ECB reviews its operational framework, conversations with eight sources indicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This issue must come back, by the framework review, at the latest,\" one of the sources said. \"The reserve requirement is artificially low.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "EXCESS LIQUIDITY\n",
      "\n",
      "At the core of the issue is the 3.6 trillion euros worth of excess liquidity sloshing around in the banking system, much of it created by the ECB when inflation was too low and policymakers were trying to stimulate the economy through a cash injection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest rates are now at a record high, so the ECB's interest expense has soared on this large pool of debt and several national central banks, including the Bundesbank, are generating a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel, his Austrian counterpart Robert Holzmann and Latvia's Martin Kazaks have all made the case for a new discussion on jacking up minimum reserve requirements, a sentiment shared by at least another half a dozen on the 26-member Governing Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the sources say the ECB's board - including Isabel Schnabel, who is in charge of market operations - has not softened its opposition to the change, so any proposal faces an uphill battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ECB spokesperson declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Austria's Holzmann made the case this week for jacking the minimum reserves up tenfold to 10% but most sources dismissed this as too large and mentioned numbers in the 2% to 5% range.\n",
      "\n",
      "They note that Croatia's rate was 9% before it joined the euro on Jan 1 and its banking system functioned well.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROS AND CONS\n",
      "\n",
      "A key question is whether the change serves a policy purpose or is simply viewed as a punitive device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its supporters say that if cutting the rate to zero this year had a policy purpose, then so does increasing the multiplier, since the outcome is similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also historical precedents, and the overall impact would be to restrict banks' ability to lend, and this would help dampen inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also say that since banks benefited from the ECB's copious asset buys in the past, it is only fair they pay for some of the cost now, especially because their large profits are now being paid out to shareholders, a morally debatable outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a public institution, the ECB's job is to conduct policy at the lowest cost, so reducing losses is not inconsistent with that mandate, they argue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents -- who also include France's Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Belgium's Pierre Wunsch -- meanwhile say that the main policy instrument is the interest rate and the bank is already using too many tools, so one more would overcomplicate policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The board's key argument is that excess liquidity is distributed unevenly across the euro zone and raising the ratio would put an excessive burden on smaller banks with a larger portion of deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The gain is miniscule and I'm yet to be convinced there is a monetary policy justification,\" another source said. \"We're not in the business of making social policy, so punishing banks is not a legitimate objective.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview last week, Schnabel said the ECB should be cautious about making such changes before it decides on how much excess liquidity it wants to maintain over the longer term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher charges could also force banks to move liquidity outside the euro zone, while a small increase in ratio would cut central bank losses only by tiny amounts, so the ECB would engage in a risky policy with a modest benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any sensible tweak - a 1% increase to 2% - in the minimum reserve requirement would have a second-order impact on the level of excess liquidity and would only save the Eurosystem (around) 6 billion euros on yearly interest payments at the current deposit rate,\" Barclays said in a note.\n",

      "The implicit bias of present-day generative AI models make their rapid adoption in the financial sector hazardous, according to a report by a financial technology expert working for the Bank of England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kathleen Blake’s report, published Wednesday, splits AI model bias into two categories — bias based on underlying training data, and bias based on the results of model output. Although both reflect the human biases that developers and creators bring to AI models, the former category is impossible to counteract just by getting rid of data points that indicate, for example, femininity or non-whiteness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blake likened data bias to the practice of redlining in mortgage lending. In a redlining system, home insurers and mortgage lenders assess non-white customers as “risky” based on their neighborhood, making credit and insurance more difficult to come by for people of color, while not directly attributing denials or higher prices to race. Similar logic is already visible in AI systems, Blake noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[T]he model may make underlying correlations that lead to biased decision-making based on non-protected features,” Blake wrote. “In other words, the remaining, non-protected features could act as proxies for protected characteristics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Societal bias, by contrast, is “where norms and negative legacy from a society cause blind spots.” Blake cited an Amazon recruitment algorithm that tended to recommend more male candidates than female, because the data, historically, showed that males tended to be hired more often.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI bias is particularly dangerous in the financial sector, Blake warned. Trust in the banking system is at serious risk from the aforementioned biases displayed by AI, given that (while noticeably less discriminatory than human decision-makers), AI still charged higher rates to Black and Latinx mortgage customers when compared white ones. Moreover, the opaque “black box” nature of proprietary models means that, if a large group of important firms uses them for similar purposes, their actions could have a huge effect on the economy as a whole, and be fairly unpredictable into the bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blake acknowledged that this type of destabilizing AI event hasn’t happened yet, but warned that the risks are very real, citing a 2021 case in which Apple and Goldman Sachs were investigated by the New York State Department of Financial Services for algorithmically offering smaller lines of credit to women.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beyond the inherent issues with bias, fairness and ethics, this could potentially lead to stability issues for financial institutions or the financial system as a whole,” Blake wrote.\n",

Those that can reuse will and have been getting absorbed quickly, especially nowadays with the cost of construction being so high.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“We have looked at what customers do and if they’re coming into a branch and that helps us adjust staffing,” he said. “Sometimes that results in a branch closing because customers are not coming there anymore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve closed some over the past couple years and a lot of times it’s been where we might have two or three branches (nearby) and one has the lion’s share of transactions over the others,” Stenstrom added.\n",

      "Fifth Third has closed 33 branch offices in Michigan since 2019, according to FDIC data, including prominent buildings in downtown Traverse City in 2018 and in downtown Holland in 2022. The bank still has a presence in downtown Traverse City and maintains several branches surrounding downtown Holland.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both were very cool pieces of property, and we said, ‘Let’s find something to benefit the downtown,’” Stenstrom said. “The formula for us doesn’t change, it’s where our customers tell us they want to do their business. Downtown Holland is more of a tourism area and people don’t usually come there to do banking anymore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to real estate experts and banking officials, former bank branches are typically easy to backfill with new uses. The properties “usually don’t sit for very long,” Stenstrom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One obstacle is that most locations are deed restricted and can’t be taken over by another financial institution. Murray said common new uses for bank branches are insurance agencies or dental offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former bank branches also often include drive-thrus, which has become highly sought after in a retail location, especially since the pandemic, said Hillary Taatjes Woznick, partner and senior vice president at NAI Wisinski of West Michigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lot of times, these banks are well-positioned and they will attract strong new uses like gas stations and car washes,” Taatjes Woznick said. “We’re excited when we see properties available because in West Michigan our inventory is so tight and low right now, we’re thrilled to see things listed because we need more properties to sell.”\n",

      "MARRAKECH, Morocco, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Kenya is planning to buy back up to a quarter of its $2 billion 2024 international bond before year-end after it secures new loans, central bank governor Kamau Thugge told Reuters, a move aimed at alleviating concerns it can repay the looming debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country is in talks to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in commercial loans from two regional policy banks, Trade & Development Bank and the African Export-Import Bank, Thugge said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF meetings in Marrakech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would use part of that for the buyback, for the liability management, and the rest would be for the budget support,\" said Thugge, who earlier this month said Kenya was expecting to \"progressively reduce the liability of the Eurobond\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would like to start as quickly as possible,\" he said of the buyback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenya's approach to repaying the $2 billion 2024 bond is being watched closely by overseas investors, given its rising debt repayments, weakening currency and soaring bond yields, which have locked many developing countries out of international capital markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thugge said Kenya is also in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an \"augmentation\" of its loan programme, which is undergoing its sixth review in November, and with the World Bank to add to a $750 million loan planned for March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't mind actually asking for exceptional access,\" the governor added. \"Of course it has additional conditionalities and requirements, but the kind of reforms we are undertaking... we can put that on the table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptional access would allow Kenya to ask for more than its limit of IMF funding. If more funds are approved, it would be the third increase to the loan programme, which was originally set at $2.3 billion in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Kenya continues to be unable to issue new international bonds and has to repay the $2 billion from its foreign currency reserves, the reserves would still be at about $7 billion by the end of June 2024, Thugge said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of Oct. 5, the central bank said it had $6.9 billion in usable foreign exchange reserves, enough to cover around 3.7 months' worth of imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central bank held its main interest rate (KECBIR=ECI) at 10.5% on Oct. 3. Inflation had edged up to 6.8% in September from 6.7% the month before, having fallen below the 7.5% target in June for the first time in a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are still having some pressures on the exchange rate, so we would like to at least maintain the interest rates where they are for some time,\" Thugge said, declining to specify a timeframe.\n",

The bill would allow financial institutions to provide legally-operating cannabis businesses access to critical banking services – including bank accounts, credit cards, and checks – without fear of retribution by federal regulators.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Current federal law forces Colorado's cannabis businesses to operate on a cash basis – exposing them to unnecessary risks and creating compliance and oversight challenges,” said Bennet. “I'm glad the Senate is finally moving forward on this common sense legislation to bring our laws into the 21st century and ensure legal businesses in Colorado can access our banking system and protect their customers and employees.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Currently, most cannabis businesses in states where it has been legalized are denied access to the banking system. The SAFER Banking Act would resolve these issues by providing a safe harbor for banks, credit unions, other financial institutions, and payment processors that provide services to these State-sanctioned businesses, allowing them to operate in the financial mainstream. By shifting these businesses and their employees away from cash-reliant operations, this bill helps to promote public safety for the communities in which they operate. In 2022, burglary or attempted burglary accounted for 96% of marijuana industry-related offenses in Denver.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to enhancing public safety, giving legal cannabis businesses access to banking services would make it easier for communities of color to participate in the growing cannabis industry.

      "\n",
      "Inflation, which had eased steadily to 2.3% in July from a peak of 6.3% last year, marched upward to 3.7% last month. However, that was unlikely to compel the BOK to resume hiking rates as the central bank expected a brief rise in inflation before cooling by year-end.\n",

      "BEIJING, Oct 17 (Reuters) - China has told state-owned banks to roll over existing local government debt with longer-term loans at lower interest rates, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, as part of Beijing's efforts to reduce debt risks in a faltering economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt-laden municipalities represent a major risk to the world's second-largest economy and its financial stability, economists say, amid a deepening property crisis, years of over-investment in infrastructure and soaring costs to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.58 trillion), or 76% of the country's economic output in 2022, up from 62.2% in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of that is debt issued by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), which cities use to raise money for infrastructure projects, often at the urging of the central government when it needs to boost economic growth. Empty coffers could make it harder for Beijing to kickstart a sputtering economic recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The People's Bank of China (PBOC) issued orders last week to major state lenders to extend terms, adjust repayment plans, and reduce interest rates on outstanding loans to LGFVs, according to the sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loans that were due in 2024 or before will be categorized as \"normal\" instead of non-performing if they overdue, and that won't affect banks' performance evaluations, one of the sources said. Reuters is reporting these measures for banks to defuse local debt risks for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure banks do not incur heavy losses from the debt restructuring, interest rates on rolled over loans should not be below China's Treasury bond rates, said one source, adding that loan terms should not exceed 10 years. China's benchmark 10-year government bond is now yielding around 2.7%, while the benchmark one-year loan prime rate is 3.45%.\n",

At approximately 8:58 a.m. on April 8, 2023, Petyoshin entered the Rockland Trust Bank in Falmouth, placed an alleged bomb on the teller counter and brandished a firearm. Petyoshin pointed the firearm at the tellers and customers, telling one bank employee, “I’m robbing you,” before having the customers and bank employees zip-tie each other’s hands together. Petyoshin then had two additional tellers place over $20,000 in cash from the bank into a brown bag, took a customer’s car keys and fled the scene in the customer’s vehicle. Petyoshin then boarded a 1:15 p.m. return ferry to Martha’s Vineyard.\n",

      "On May 23, 2023, Petyoshin was arrested on state charges in connection with the robbery. A subsequent search of his residence in Edgartown, Mass. resulted in the recovery of thousands of dollars in cash bundled together in Rockland Trust money bands, zip ties and clothing items the suspect was captured wearing on surveillance footage both before and after the robbery. Additionally, 57 firearms and a large quantity of ammunition were seized during the search. The same jacket worn by the robber inside the Rockland Trust bank was recovered during a search of Petyoshin’s personal locker at the Oak Bluffs Water Department where he is employed. The investigation also determined that the Facebook page for Petyoshin’s clothing store, Dapper Martha’s Vineyard, displayed photos of the same clothing – including jacket, sunglasses and wig – he wore during the bank robbery.\n",

As a result of the CFPB’s supervisory work, the companies in today’s report are refunding $140 million to consumers, $120 million of which is for surprise overdraft fees and double-dipping on non-sufficient funds fees. A separate report today finds that most financial institutions have eliminated non-sufficient funds fees, saving consumers an estimated $2 billion every year.\n",

In situations when borrowers paid off their loan early or had their vehicle repossessed, CFPB examiners found that loan servicers continued to charge fees for the add-on products, which no longer offered any value. Sloppy international money transfers: CFPB examiners found remittance providers charged hidden fees by taking money out of the funds consumers sent without properly disclosing them. In other instances, CFPB examiners found remittance providers failed to refund fees when the money consumers sent failed to arrive on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, CFPB examiners found how service providers contribute to many banks’ illegal fee practices. These companies provide critical deposit, payment, and data processing services to many banks’ operation systems. Those operation systems have contributed to banks’ double-dipping on non-sufficient funds fees on a single transaction. The CFPB directed these service providers to stop supporting banks’ ability violate the law.\n",

      "Both Live Oak and U.S. Banks offer bank business loans that may be solid options depending on the small business owner’s needs. Live Oak has a leg up on U.S. Bank as an SBA lender. But U.S. Bank offers one of the best equipment loans around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose Live Oak for SBA loans\n",
      "\n",
      "Live Oak offers the highest loan limits between the two lenders and offers long repayment terms. Live Oak gives out loans amounts up to $15 million on SBA loans, which is considerably higher than U.S. Bank’s SBA loan limit of $12.375 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to note that interest rates, loan amounts and eligibility will differ for each business owner. Business owners with good or excellent credit scores will get the best interest rates on a loan. Certain businesses may not qualify for an SBA loan with Live Oak depending on income, time in business and other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose U.S. Bank for equipment loans\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. Bank offers the most expansive equipment loan options. While Live Oak offers USDA loans that could be used to finance business equipment, only certain rural and agricultural businesses qualify for this loan type. U.S. Bank provides a specific loan for equipment with no industry restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lender’s equipment loan has multiple benefits to offer. Businesses can apply for up to $1 million in equipment financing. The loan can also be used to finance various pieces of equipment. Plus, equipment loans from U.S. Bank are secured by the equipment you purchase, so business owners don’t have to offer any down payment for the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatives\n",
      "\n",
      "When shopping for a business loan, looking at your options is a good idea. For example, a business credit card may be a better option for small equipment purchases since you can avoid interest payments if you pay your balance in full each month. And if you can’t qualify for SBA 7(a) loans, other lenders offer different types of SBA loans beyond what either lender offers, including SBA microloans and Express Loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both lenders likely require good-to-excellent credit and two or more years in business for approval. Other lenders specialize in helping business owners with bad credit and startups get approved for financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Live Oak and U.S. Bank offer several business loan options. As SBA Preferred Lenders, both can help you get SBA loans faster than other lenders. But Live Oak is far more experienced in providing SBA 7(a) loans and offers a few extra benefits to its borrowers. U.S. Bank gives the best option for equipment loans.\n",

      "\n",
      "The operations of California-based Silicon Valley Bank in Britain had been treated as a branch for 10 years before being required to become a subsidiary, which made it easier to engineer a rapid takeover by HSBC after SVB's parent bank in the United States collapsed earlier this year.\n",

      "BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods said the central bank is now thinking about its regulatory approach to branches, which are largely supervised by regulators in their home countries. Subsidiaries are directly regulated by the BoE and must hold their own capital cushions.\n",

      "London is a magnet for foreign bank branches, which Woods said was a key part of Britain's hosting of a competitive global financial centre.\n",

      "\"That is not going to change,\" Woods told the annual Mansion House dinner for the financial sector in London's City, adding that he would be considering \"targeted areas for improvement.\"\n",

      "\"Without the post-crisis reforms, the failures of CS or SVB could have been the dominos that knocked over the entire global banking system,\" Woods said, adding there was more work to do to ensure banks can fail in a controlled, non-contagious manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "More capital and liquidity would not necessarily be the answer to issues raised by this year's banking turmoil as the best rules would be useless without effective supervision and sustainable bank business models, Woods said.\n",

Perhaps it's one that needs no introduction, and this may be another reason to look upon the stock favorably. BAC offers the full package of products and services -- retail and commercial banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management solutions. In this article, I'll explain why I am bullish on Bank of America stock and why I think it could be a Buy this October and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put it simply, Bank of America has an attractive valuation compared to its peers and the market. The company’s stock is trading at lower multiples than the average for its peer group of banking companies and the S&P 500 Index (SPX). BAC also has strong fundamentals and growth prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe investors should consider adding Bank of America stock to their portfolios as the company continues to deliver on growth and profitability at a low valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Things Look Good for the Long Term\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank of America is one of the most attractive bank stocks for long-term investors, as it has several factors that set it apart from other banks. The first factor is its size and scale, which enable it to offer the widest range of financial products in the banking sector, it does, after all, have some $2.5 trillion in assets. The second factor is its financial strength, which is reflected in its high liquidity, capital, and regulatory ratios.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the bank's press release regarding its stress test, Bank of America has ample liquidity from various global sources and a Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio of 11.6% as of June 30, 2023, well above the minimum requirement of 9.5% that has been effective from October 1, 2023. The bank also announced that it will increase its CET1 requirement by another 0.5% starting in 2024, further enhancing its financial stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attractive Growth, Profitability, and Valuation\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank of America has shown consistent growth in both the short and long term. In the past year, it managed to increase its revenue by 5.6%, its earnings per share (EPS) by 8.8%, and its return on equity by 60 basis points. It achieved this by expanding its customer base, improving its efficiency, and reducing its expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Bank of America’s growth has been even stronger in the past five years. It grew its revenue by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5%, its net income by 6.7%, and its EPS by 12.8%. These growth figures are impressive, especially for a large and mature company like Bank of America. It shows that the bank has been able to grow its revenue and net income steadily over the years while also increasing its EPS significantly by buying back shares and reducing its equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Profitability\n",
      "\n",
      "Last quarter, Bank of America delivered impressive results. It reported an increase of 11% year-over-year in revenue, which reached $25.2 billion, while reporting a jump of 19% year-over-year in net income, which reached $7.4 billion. It has a high net margin of 29.3%, meaning that it keeps almost a third of its revenue as earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Bank of America has demonstrated high returns on its capital. It reported an 11.2% return on equity, which assesses how well the bank uses its shareholders’ capital, and BAC sure does deploy capital efficiently. It reported a 15% return on tangible book value, which measures how well the bank generates profits from its tangible assets. These metrics are above the industry averages of 9% and 13%, respectively. Furthermore, Bank of America’s profitability has been consistent over the past few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valuation\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank of America is currently undervalued by several measures. At today’s prices, it trades at a low multiple of its earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow compared to its industry peers and to its intrinsic value. Specifically, it trades at the following multiples:\n",
      "\n",
      "7.7 times earnings, lower than the industry average of 8.8 times earnings; 2.2 times sales, lower than the industry average of 2.9 times sales; 0.81 times book value, lower than the industry average of 1.0 times book value; 4.6 times operating cash flow, lower than the industry average of 6.0 times operating cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "These valuation ratios indicate that Bank of America is trading at a discount to its peers and to its intrinsic value. It also has a low price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.585. A low PEG ratio (under 1.0 is considered low) means that the stock is cheap relative to its expected growth rate. Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investors of all time, would likely be very excited to see such a behemoth of a company trading at such a low PEG ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is BAC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to Wall Street, BAC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. At $34.40, the average BAC stock forecast implies 27.36% upside potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank of America is a profitable, growing, and undervalued stock that deserves investors’ attention. It has delivered strong results in its most recent quarter and over the past year. It has also shown consistent growth in both the short and long term while also increasing its shareholder value through buybacks and dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, it trades at a low multiple of its earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow compared to its industry peers. Therefore, I believe that Bank of America is a good stock to consider for seeking a solid and stable bank stock with upside potential.\n",

      "Tacoma –A 44-year-old former bank manager from Battle Ground, Washington, pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Tacoma to Bank Fraud and Aggravated Identify Theft, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman. Brian Davie, a former branch manager at Wells Fargo, used unauthorized cash withdrawals, money transfers, and cashier’s checks to steal over $1 million. Davie targeted elderly and vulnerable customers. Eight victims have been identified. One woman had more than $566,000 stolen from her retirement accounts. Davie is scheduled for sentencing by U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle on January 2, 2024.\n",

      "Davie worked for Wells Fargo in Battle Ground from March of 2014 until he was fired in June 2019. According to records in the case, Davie used his position as a manager at the branch to conduct unauthorized transactions. Davie had access to customer files containing information about bank account balances. Davie hid his criminal activity by repeatedly exchanging cashier’s checks until they were small enough to cash without triggering banking reporting requirements.\n",

      "The problem for homebuyers is mortgage rates were rising too:\n",
      "\n",
      "For a 30 year fixed rate mortgage, the lowest borrowing rate was a little more than 7%. By the end of the 1970s you were looking at 12% mortgages. As Paul Volcker’s Fed tried to snuff out inflation, mortgage rates topped out at nearly 19% by 1981.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, housing prices were much lower back then but affordability in monthly payments in the early-1980s experienced a similar spike as what we’ve witnessed today, through a combination of both rising housing prices and an insane spike in borrowing rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem for homebuyers back then, much like today, is housing prices refused to come down. Here’s a look at housing price growth in the 1970s and 1980s:\n",

      "Yes, things were more muted on an inflation-adjusted basis but the combination of ever-rising prices coupled with double-digit mortgage rates couldn’t have been easy to stomach.\n",

      "Last week’s unusual turbulence in US Treasuries points to a deeper issue than just the latest reading of the runes on inflation and the interest rate intentions of the Federal Reserve. The US bond market is losing its strategic footing, whether in economics, policy, or technical aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are readily available short-term explanations for the rollercoaster ride in yields that has garnered significant attention in the US and beyond. Early in the week, dovish statements by several Fed officials influenced market sentiment by indicating the possibility of no further interest rate hikes as the market had been doing the heavy lifting for them. Geopolitical concerns reinforced the yield movements. Bonds rallied sharply with yields falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midweek, the focus shifted to inflation data, including certain measures that came in hotter than expected at both the producer and consumer levels. On Friday, geopolitical worries resurfaced as the market feared an escalation of the tragic conflict in the Middle East. On Thursday alone, the 10-year Treasury yield swung nearly 0.2 percentage points between an intraday high and low.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my primary concern lies elsewhere: the most influential segment of the world’s financial markets is losing its longer-term strategic anchors and is at risk of losing its short-term stabiliser ones as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent consensus on economic growth for the world’s largest economy has been erratic, with forecasts fluctuating between a soft and a hard landing with the occasional mention of crash and no landings as well. Expectations about the Fed’s actions have similarly fluctuated, from potential rate cuts in the near term to maintaining higher rates for a longer period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Reserve policy is further shrouded in uncertainty, with questions over what the equilibrium level of interest rates should be, the delayed effects of a concentrated cycle of rate rises, the impact of a shrinking balance sheet and the absence of an effective framework for monetary policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this occurs in a context of substantial fiscal deficits that show no signs of significant moderation, for reasons that include Congressional dysfunction and the considerable bills associated with past promises and ongoing transitions in response to critical challenges such as climate change. Consequently, the balance of risks suggests more significant fiscal pressures than originally anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "This uncertainty also extends to longer-term supply and demand dynamics. Despite rising interest rates, there is genuine doubt about who will readily absorb the additional supply of government debt associated with high deficits. The Fed, which was the most reliable buyer for over a decade with a seemingly limitless printing press and little price sensitivity, is now selling bonds, reversing its quantitative easing programmes since the financial crisis with quantitative tightening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign buyers seem more hesitant, including for geopolitical reasons. A significant portion of the large domestic institutional investor base, such as pension funds and insurance companies, already holds substantial quantities of bonds at large mark-to-market losses. Additionally, concerns about the stability of regional bank deposits persist, possibly leading them to sell bonds if deposits decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, the bond market still possesses some short-term stabilisers, which have mitigated even more extreme daily fluctuations. Sudden surges in yields attract buyers seeking greater certainty to lock in higher income for the long term, while sudden drops in yields translate into higher prices, allowing some overexposed investors to lighten up on any holdings where they are sitting on paper losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s important to note that their resilience should not be taken for granted. No matter how you look at it, the world’s most crucial benchmark market is on an unpredictable journey with an uncertain destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall during the transition I made approximately 25 years ago from the public to the private sector when I was cautioned by a bond trader that there would be moments when technical factors would override fundamentals, resulting in price volatility that could potentially destabilise both the financial markets and the broader economy. He was applying this good old-fashioned “tail wagging the dog” phenomenon to emerging markets. Without a more concerted effort to reestablish key anchors, it seems that this warning needs to be taken more seriously in the most systemic segment of mature markets.\n",

      "Yet the picture is not as clear cut as last year, when a brutal market selloff saw stocks fall to a nearly two-year low in mid-October. That was followed by a 28% rally in the S&P 500 through late July of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indicators such as the AAII do not yet suggest the pessimistic sentiment is \"excessive\", which would be more clear if the spread between bulls and bears was wider, according to Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Hi Mount Research.\n",

      "For example, bearish sentiment stood at 56% in the AAII survey last October.\n",

      "Kim Forrest has long considered herself a staunch proponent of stocks. Lately, however, she's been giving more thought to a more staid part of markets: fixed income. \"You kind of get the math of this and you go, 'Hey, if we think we're at peak interest rates for this cycle, it might be time to buy some bonds,'\" said Forrest, founder of Bokeh Capital Partners. \"Oddly enough, even though ... God knows I'm an equity girl, I'm thinking bonds. Bonds could be a good thing.\" Bonds are starting to make a lot of sense for investors, Forrest said. Treasurys have lost half their value from their peak, according to Bank of America. And, last week, the 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level in 16 years. Even after pulling back somewhat from those levels, the benchmark yield remains within striking distance of the key 5% threshold. Forrest isn't alone in her thinking that now might be an attractive entry point for bonds. The potential unwinding of what BofA recently called the \"greatest bond bear market in history\" has more investors trying to lock in higher yields ahead of potential rate cuts next year from the Federal Reserve. 'A lot for us to love bonds' Other investors are building out their bond exposure. Nancy Tengler, investment chief at Laffer Tengler Investments, said her team started adding bonds last summer after getting out in August 2020. She's been building \"very short ladders\" for her clients — buying 3-month, 6-month and even 9-month Treasurys — to take advantage of the near-term peak in the yield curve. \"We have clients who have income needs, and this is a pretty attractive time to own the short end of the curve,\" Tengler said. Meanwhile, Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, said he is extending the duration of maturities for the bonds he's buying to try to lock in yields for longer. He said he's trying to stay in higher quality bonds at the longer end of the curve. Elsewhere, Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" this week that she's bullish on bonds for the first time in years. \"I've been doing this job for about a decade now,\" Roland said. \"This is actually the first time that we've been overweight bonds in portfolios. It takes a lot for us to love bonds.\" To be sure, Roland is not sure how much longer bonds will remain attractive. In fact, she expects she will go back to being overweight stocks in time after the downshift in yields plays out, saying equities remain a \"much more powerful compounder of wealth over time.\" However, fixed income strategists say that bonds will continue to remain attractive as the U.S. is unlikely to have rates held near zero as it had over the prior decade. \"We don't think that we're gonna go back to the low-interest rate environment that we just came out of. So we don't we don't think that it necessarily has to be a trade off necessarily between stocks and bonds,\" said Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income strategist at LPL Financial. \"We think both are viable asset classes again.\" Investor plays For those interested in adding exposure, Bokeh Capital's Forrest recommends investors skim maybe 10% to 20% of their equity exposure into government bonds or high quality corporate debt. Meanwhile, Sit Investment's Doty and LPL Financial's Gillum said individual core bond funds and ETFs that track the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index would be a good place to start. Gillum also recommends ladder portfolios to navigate the current interest rate volatility in markets. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) is down by more than 11% this year, but higher by more than 4% just this week. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) is off by more than 2% in 2023, but greater than 1% on the week. Separately, Sit's Doty thinks investors with a greater risk tolerance should also add some exposure to high yield bonds — about a 5% allocation — saying the risks are likely mitigated after September's blockbuster jobs report continued to show a resilient economy. Corporations that issue high-yield bonds generally have lower credit quality, meaning they could have greater levels of debt that put them at risk in an uncertain macro environment. \"If you have large-cap equities, I think it'd make a lot of sense to move a piece of that into high yield and investment grade bonds,\" Doty added. \"And you'll end up with a more stable portfolio without really giving up much return. In fact, you might even be enhancing your return.\" Looming risks Of course, there are risks ahead that could drive yields higher, meaning prices could drop for investors. One possible \"wildcard\" on the horizon is a potential shutdown if the government fails to agree on a spending bill by the Nov. 17 deadline, Doty said. Depending on how markets take the news, that could potentially drive a selloff in bonds, he said. Still, Doty expects the risk is skewed to the downside. Notably, he expects the breakout of the Hamas-Israel conflict over the weekend that spurred a flight to safety into Treasurys could mean near-term peak is in for yields. Before this weekend, Doty said he expected the 10-year yield would top 5%. On Wednesday, four days after the start of the war, the benchmark yield hit 4.544%, or its lowest level since last month. \"So a year from now, I can't imagine the Fed not having cut rates,\" Doty said. \"And it just seems like yields will be lower across the board.\"\n",

      "The volatility in the world’s biggest bond market in recent weeks has been too much for U.S. stocks to handle as investors come to terms with the likelihood that interest rates will remain high deep into 2024 until underlying inflationary pressures ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Treasury market, the bedrock of the global financial system, has been hammered by repeated selling since late September, sending the yields on the 10-year and 30-year Treasurys to levels last seen when the economy was moving toward the financial crisis in 200, before yields fell again in the past week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in September a bond market selloff was fueled by a hawkish outlook from the Federal Reserve, along with mounting concern about the U.S. fiscal deficit and federal debt amid the potential for a government shutdown if a budget for the 2024 fiscal year is not settled by mid-November.\n",

      "Earlier this week though, increased uncertainty about the conflict in the Middle East propelled demand for safer assets and caused longer-term bond prices to jump and their yields to fall.\n",

The U.S. stocks fell and booked their worst day in five sessions on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors are now wondering what it will take for interest rates and bond yields to fall in the months ahead and whether a retreat in yields could eventually push stocks higher to rally into the year-end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, said “excessive pessimism” in the bond market is setting up for a relief rally both in stock and bond prices as “there’s not as much inflationary pressures as the market has been pricing in,” he told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hayes said his team found the bond sentiment data has started to reflect a “decisive reversal” away from too much pessimism in the Treasury market which could send bond yields lower and boost equities given the inverse correlations between the S&P 500 SPX and the 10-year Treasury note yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y.\n",
      "\n",
      "See: Here is what needs to happen for the S&P 500 to hold on to this year’s gains\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, some analysts said disinflation may not be enough for the Federal Reserve to drop its “higher-for-longer” interest rate narrative which was primarily responsible for the big spike in yields since September.\n",
      "\n",
      "The economy needs a slowdown in the consumer sector for some relaxation in the Fed’s “higher-for-longer” narrative and to maybe push policymakers to adopt a more flexible outlook for its long-term guidance, said Thierry Wizman, global FX and interest rates strategist at Macquarie.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, the Fed right now is certainly not saying anything that’s remotely suggestive of ‘high-for-long’ being taken away or being removed or negated, so I don’t expect yields to fall a lot unless we start to get reasons to believe the Fed is going to remove that narrative based on the economic data,” Wizman told MarketWatch via phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Wizman said he is confident that the U.S. consumption data will weaken over the next few months when major consumer-product and -service companies start to provide guidance for the fourth quarter, and when U.S. consumers, which have been trapped in a web of conflicting signals on the health of the economy, open their wallet for the holiday shopping season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This will produce some weakness on the consumer side of the market and there’s no doubt the slowdown will be more pronounced than most people expect in the economy, [but] that will be the positive scenario for bonds,” said Marco Pirondini, head of U.S. equities at Amundi U.S., in an interview with MarketWatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, that also means investors should not be “too anxious to buy dips in the stock market” because it would be very unusual if the stock market doesn’t see “multiple compression” with Treasury yields at 16-year highs, Wizman said. “Stocks would still look too rich even if the Fed drops the ‘higher-for-longer’ narrative in the first quarter of 2024.”\n",
      "\n",
      "See: Fed skips rate hike for now, but doesn’t rule out another increase this year\n",
      "\n",
      "The “higher-for-longer” mantra is an idea Fed officials have tried to get the market to absorb in recent months, with Fed Chair Powell hardening his rhetoric at the September FOMC meeting, pointing potentially to more rate hikes or, more importantly, interest rates that stay higher for longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fed officials saw interest rates coming down to 5.1% in 2024, higher than June’s outlook for rates to finish next year at 4.6%, according to the latest Summary of Economic Projections at the September policy meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "See: Stock-market moves show bond traders are still in charge as yields renew rise\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Wizman characterized the “higher-than-longer” narrative as a “publicity stunt,” as he thought Fed officials simply wanted to signal to the market that they were frustrated that financial conditions hadn’t measurably tightened enough in 2023, so they utilized the narrative to get rising Treasury yields to do some of the “heavy lifting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“… Fed officials are not really serious about ‘higher-for-longer’ – they just did it to drive long-term yields higher for now,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a slowdown in the consumer sector of the economy and ongoing disinflation are powerful enough to sap Fed’s rate expectations, Treasury yields could continue to decline without having to have a calamity or big recession in the U.S. economy to drive investors back to the safe-haven assets like Treasurys, strategists said.\n",
      "\n",
      "See: U.S. stock-market seasonality suggests a potential rally in the fourth quarter. Why this time might be different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, stock-market seasonality may also help lift sentiment. Historically, the fourth quarter has been the best quarter for the U.S. stock market, with the large-cap S&P 500 index up nearly 80% of the time dating back to 1950 and gaining more than 4% on average.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S&P 500 has risen 0.9% so far in the fourth quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP has advanced 1.4% in October, according to FactSet data.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you have this situation where sentiment got stretched and now sentiment is reversing with more confidence that bond yields have reached their peak, so equities can rally moving into the end of the year, and that should start to become increasingly evident,” said Hayes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 8.2 basis points to 4.628% on Friday, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y declined by 9.2 basis points to 4.777%.

      "\n",
      "Market breadth refers to the underlying participation of securities in a stock market rally. In other words, is a stock market rally being driven by only a handful of the largest companies, or is the majority S&P 500 companies also moving higher amid a broader market rally?\n",

      "\n",
      "Other bearish factors that could weigh down stocks into the end of the year include a decline in earnings revisions among Wall Street analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Earnings revisions breadth for the overall S&P 500 has fallen sharply over the last couple of weeks (the most significant 2-week decline since July 2022),\" Wilson said, adding that rosy projections for 12% profit growth in 2024 could be revised lower as third-quarter earnings season gets underway.\n",

      "STARKVILLE, Miss. -- Some Mississippi landowners selling carbon offsets through a company geared to smaller tracts of land have lost that source of income this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curtis VanderSchaaf, a forester with the Mississippi State University Extension Service, said the one-year harvest deferral program previously offered by the Natural Capital Exchange, or NCX, has ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This forest carbon market program provided a way for forest landowners to help reduce the impacts of greenhouse gas by sequestering and storing carbon from their forests,” VanderSchaaf said. “NCX was different than most of these markets that have relatively long contractual commitments, require a capital investment and require large minimum acreages for participation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "NCX directly catered to smaller scale, private forest landowners by allowing them to sell carbon offsets based on one-year harvest deferrals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“NCX is not out of business, but they did away with the one-year harvest deferral,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest carbon offset market grew out of companies’ efforts to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their carbon footprints. While the NCX program was easy for Mississippi timber owners to participate in, it has gone away with no similar replacement program available.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are two types of carbon markets: voluntary and involuntary or compliance,” VanderSchaaf said. “NCX and a couple of others are voluntary, meaning the buyer is choosing to participate, not mandated or regulated by law to purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A compliance market is a cap and trade. That’s where a government agency caps the amount of emissions an industry can emit. If businesses exceed the amount allocated to them -- the cap -- they either have to ‘trade’ for credits from another business in the industry that is using less than their allocated amount, or purchase offsets from somebody else, such as a forest landowner,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of these efforts is that industries reduce the global impact of greenhouses gases, which are harmful to the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the one-year harvest deferral program NCX offered is gone, other options are available. However, it is more difficult now for those who own small acreage or who want short-term contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Industries that have to offset their emissions by law need to have a steady supply of that carbon offset,” he said. “They would rather purchase from a large landowner or from an aggregator who has organized participating smaller landowners to offer a large supply of long-term carbon offsets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These long-term contracts can be up to 100 years, although some markets have terms as short as 20 or 40 years with requirements as to minimum acreage and harvests.\n",
      "\n",
      "“NCX was directed toward forest landowners in the Southeast. Most of the other programs are geared toward the West or Northeast,” VanderSchaaf said. “Because of the long-term contracts and the steady supply of carbon offsets or credits, these contracts pay more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jessie Purvis, a landowner in Rankin County, participated in the NCX program in 2021 and 2022 after extensively researching to determine any risks involved or long-term penalties. He was skeptical going into the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trees and many other natural resources already capture carbon and are readily renewable, so exactly why is a payment due for something that already exists?” he asked. “Shouldn’t it be for a new carbon capture operation? I’ve seen some of the same things happen in the past, and while they make great headlines and put money in pockets of well-connected individuals and businesses, many times they don’t really do what they are promoted to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Through NCX, Purvis received just over $14 an acre for his one-year harvest deferral on enrolled timberland.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Based on a one-year operation, losing the NCX program reduces the income from this tree farm by $10-$20 per acre per year while still growing timber,” Purvis said. “It doesn’t change anything about how I will operate the property overall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Purvis said he could possibly participate in a few other carbon credit programs, but doing so would tie up his land and prevent harvests for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t plan to do anything that ties me or the land up like that,” Purvis said. “My plans may change, the land uses may need to change, health and financial needs change; therefore, I am unwilling to commit to any long-term deal.”\n",

      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communicates the stance of monetary policy through a target range for the federal funds rate, which is the rate set in the market for uncollateralized short-term lending and borrowing of central bank reserves in the U.S. Since the global financial crisis, the market for federal funds has changed markedly. In this post, we take a closer look at who is currently trading in the federal funds market, as well as the reasons for their participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed Funds Market\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal funds (or fed funds) market enables depository institutions to directly trade central bank reserves in the U.S. In this market, depository institutions and other financial entities—mainly government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)—borrow and lend funds on an uncollateralized basis, typically with overnight maturity. The fed funds market is key for monetary policy implementation and has historically played an important role in the redistribution of reserves across the banking system. Prior to 2008, reserves were in the tens of billions of dollars and the fed funds market was very active, with participants consistently borrowing, lending, and intermediating throughout the day to meet their statutory reserve requirements. Effective October 1, 2008, Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay depository institutions interest on their reserve balances. In addition, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet to support the U.S. economy—first during the global financial crisis and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic—leading to reserves reaching $4 trillion in late 2021, as discussed in this post. In this new environment, the need to actively borrow in the fed funds market has waned. Daily trading volume dropped from around $150-$175 billion, or around 2 percent of commercial bank assets, prior to 2008 (as estimated in this post) to around $60-$80 billion per day in the 2010s, increasing to an average of $110 billion, or 0.5 percent of bank assets, per day in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "With reserves elevated in the banking system, who is now borrowing and lending in the fed funds market? And why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Borrowers in the Fed Funds Market\n",
      "\n",
      "As the chart below shows, the main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches). Since 2016, FBO branches have borrowed around $45-$110 billion per day, representing between 65 and 95 percent of the total daily volume in the fed funds market. FBO branches are the most common structure of foreign banking in the U.S., and they generally engage in activities similar to those of domestic banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "FBO Branches Are the Main Borrowers in the Fed Funds Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources: Federal Reserve Form FR 2420, Report of Selected Money Market Rates; authors’ calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The chart shows quarterly average federal funds volume by borrower type from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike domestic banks, however, most FBO branches are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) after amendments to the International Banking Act disallowed new branches of FBOs from obtaining deposit insurance. This regulatory difference has two important implications for why FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market: First, it limits their access to deposits—the main source of domestic bank funding—making fed funds an important source of their short-term funding. Second, since they do not pay the FDIC assessment fee, most FBO branches face an effective cost of borrowing fed funds that is lower than that of domestic banks. Lower funding costs give FBO branches an advantage over their domestic counterparts in arbitraging fed funds offered at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate, as they can effectively earn a larger spread by borrowing fed funds and depositing the borrowed funds at the Fed. Furthermore, differences in regulatory requirements across jurisdictions make engaging in the arbitrage trade less costly and less capital intensive for FBO branches. Specifically, leverage ratios in foreign jurisdictions are often calculated as a period-end snapshot, as opposed to daily or weekly averages in the U.S., which allows FBO branches more flexibility to borrow between reporting dates and simply unwind their positions on month-end or quarter-end dates to maintain higher reported leverage ratios.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chart above shows that domestic banks are also borrowers in the fed funds market. Borrowing by domestic banks ranged from $2.5 billion in late 2021 to $25 billion in mid-2019, representing between 5 and 35 percent, respectively, of the total daily volume of fed funds traded.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown in the next chart, their borrowing increases when aggregate reserves decline. This finding is consistent with results from the November 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS), where more than 70 percent of domestic banks responded that they were likely or very likely to borrow in unsecured funding markets—including the fed funds market—as a way to build liquidity if their level of reserve balances were to fall below a minimum threshold (see this summary of the SFOS results).\n",

      "Who’s Lending in the Fed Funds Market?\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) are the top lenders in the fed funds market. The FHLBs are GSEs that support mortgage lending and community investments and are organized as cooperatives owned by their members. The eleven FHLBs raise funds in global markets through the sale of debt securities that they then lend to their members through collateralized loans (called “advances”), which represent around two-thirds of their total assets (see the FHLB financial reports). As the next chart shows, GSEs dominate lending in the fed funds market and are responsible for more than 90 percent of the total daily volume of fed funds traded.\n",
      "\n",
      "FHLBs Are the Main Lenders in the Fed Funds Market\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources: Federal Reserve Form FR 2420, Report of Selected Money Market Rates; authors’ calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The chart shows quarterly average federal funds volume by lender type from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two primary factors contribute to FHLBs’ willingness to lend in the fed funds market. First, FHLBs must hold liquidity portfolios—partly to meet minimum regulatory requirements, but also to satisfy advances to their members. Fed funds are key instruments in such portfolios, along with interest-bearing deposit accounts and other selected short-term investments such as reverse repos. This means that FHLBs turn to the fed funds market to invest excess cash holdings. Second, unlike domestic banks and FBO branches, FHLBs do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, which creates an incentive for them to lend at rates below the IORB rate. In turn, this incentive to lend at low rates triggers the arbitrage mechanism between fed funds rates and the IORB rate, making it a regular phenomenon rather than an anomaly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two additional points are noteworthy here. First, since FHLBs have access to the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility that the Fed introduced in 2013, they are unwilling to lend at rates below the ON RRP rate. Second, since FHLBs face counterparty credit limits, the aggregate volume lent to a single counterparty is often limited (see here for details on these limits), which favors that a nontrivial arbitrage spread usually prevails.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chart above shows that domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market, but at very small volumes. This is due to their ability to earn the IORB rate, which disincentivizes them from lending reserves in the fed funds market when the clearing rate is below IORB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrapping Up\n",
      "\n",
      "The fed funds market has changed dramatically since 2008: The Fed expanded its balance sheet to support the U.S. economy, resulting in reserves in the banking system increasing substantially, and it also began paying interest on these reserve balances. Daily volume in the fed funds market has decreased substantially and market dynamics have evolved to capture arbitrage activity between FHLBs and branches of foreign banks.\n",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla., Oct. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - Significant influences driving the CAR T-cell therapy market is a rising demand for model therapeutics for treatment of cancer, increase in prevalence of cancer and an escalating awareness of CAR T-cell therapy medicines. The CAR T-cell therapy market is currently going through a rapid expansion, owing to rapidly expanding clinical trial activities and recent commercialization of CAR-T cell therapy, which are expected to offer lucrative opportunities for market expansion and flourishing opportunities. The rise in awareness and upsurge in approvals of new CAR T-cell therapies and promising advanced drugs present in pipelines are anticipated to offer remunerative opportunities for the expansion for the global CAR T-cell therapy market in the near future. Some of the benefits of CAR T-cell therapies over conventional drugs, include the destruction of cancer cells using patients' immune system, early recovery, and shortened treatment time. In addition, CAR T-cell therapy survives for a long time in the body, as they have the ability to recognize and target cancer cells even if the cancer relapses. According to a report released by Precedence Research, the global cell therapy market was valued at US$ 12 billion in 2022 and it is expected to hit US$ 83.78 billion by 2032, poised to grow at a CAGR of 21.50% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032. Further, an additional report by Allied Market Research stated the global car t-cell therapy market size was valued at $1.7 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $6.1 billion by 2031. Active biotech and pharma companies in the markets this week include Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Regen BioPharma, Inc. (OTCPK:RGBP), Gilead Sciences, Inc.

I mean, maybe just because it's the prettiest or certainly because it's the highest volume crop and it sort of serves as the proxy for the larger grain markets to develop what sort of direction they're going to go at. And the USDA cut the yield number down to 173.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that that was a cut. I mean, I think that's what everyone expected or hoped to see. Let's say a market bull would certainly hope to see that after this drought summer. I think market bulls are going to say it should have been cut more, but the USDA is going to work in a conservative fashion. So to see that cut did allow some bullish response on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, in terms of actual one day market movement, I think you'd say probably soybeans obviously had the bigger one day movement. But note it was a one day movement. We've had things go back down again here on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Don, did anybody call you yesterday and complain about USDA?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, you know, well, you know, not this report, but, you know, and I know what Elaine is saying, but I really think the surprise in the report was all about the soybean market. You know, corn, we have over 2 billion bushel carryout. Going to be hard to change that. The soybeans, the government surprisingly, they're keeping the ending stocks at 220.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's just because they believe that's the ending stocks. That's all that's the pipeline minimum. So I think the bottom line is the soybeans probably, in fact, all the grains probably have hit a seasonal low, and that's what the report indicated. And soybeans are the upside leader, along with soybean meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager I'm going to ask you about Lowe's in a minute. But Jeff, I want to ask you, given listening about stocks and Kerry, did that get lost yesterday? And we had confirmation of a lower crop in your eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French No, I don't think you got lost. I mean, the trade knows when the USDA lowers the yield in September and then in October, it's very likely that they will do it again in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you look at soybeans, particularly the condition which the USDA does base awful lot, you would I would argue that you could see probably another half bushel reduction, if not a full bushel reduction going into November on that soybean crop. So the trade knows that, Yes, we had a big move. We we stalled out up there at $13, but we came in to that report on a dollar 50 slide.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're going to see here the pipeline supply is going to be tight in these beans and the supply is going to be tightening off all eyes on South America here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Don, there was a little conventional wisdom on that going into today. If corn could close over five, that might mean the low is in. And if we could have closed over 585, the low as in neither happened on Friday. So do we have a low yet? And what will be the indicator of one?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, I mean, I think the seasonally we have I mean, the basis levels are starting firm and end users are starting to scramble a bit. Basis levels have started to firm corn market the ethanol people, the end users also starting to try and recover at these price levels can't do it. You know, it's amazing. Since the beginning of August, we basically have been in a fight for 72 $5 trading range.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, you know, I think let's see, we get over five. There's a five, 25 and a half target gap on December. CORN That's probably the upside with a 2.1 billion carryover yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager All right, Elaine, you get the first answer. Do you agree with that sentiment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub No. I want to kind of play devil's advocate and I agree with you globally and long term. And I'm going to say may be past January once we finally get a grain stocks report that confirms my belief. And I think maybe all farmers believe that the crop just isn't there and the supply just isn't there. But I think between now and then, you've got a whole global market full of people who trade off of these these numbers and are going to continue to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so while you have, let's say, the dollar moving higher or sort of outside market doldrums, I believe it's possible for it to continue to linger or dwindle even lower. I mean, I do think it's possible for it to move lower. And we saw that on Friday, that it is possible for it to move more, at least on a day to day basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French Oh, yeah. I mean, you saw it this week. I mean, we weren't able to take out those big resistance levels, But from a from a seasonal standpoint, I agree that, you know, seasonally harvest lows are in here. The low in corn hits September 19th. You know, you look back in years past that's ideal for us for harvest low and then beans 1250 yesterday so even in a non-ideal year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I mean we'll have to see. But I just think that harvest lows have been scored here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose You know, I think the big thing you have to look at is that the big competitor is South America. I mean, between Brazil and Argentina, they're going to raise about double the size of the crop we are here. So in order for the market to significantly move higher, South America is going to have to have some weather problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, it's an El Nino year after three La Nina years. So that means that we're supposed to be dry in northern Brazil, which it kind of is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager I think you've all been on the show when we were supposed to be in El Nino years here, and it doesn't look like we've had it here yet. So do you still put stock in El Nino being a factor right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Yeah, fundamentally, sure. But, you know, it just it takes, I think, time sometimes for these markets to recognize reality. Right. We like to believe in efficient markets where we're all of the traders are coming in with their opinions and they react instantly to to an or to a forecast. But I don't know. We just haven't seen it this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's going to be we're going to have to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager All right, Jeff, let's finish up corn here. Let's look out a little bit. And I want to look out with a question that came in. Let's see. This one came up via Facebook. This is from Tim. And I want you to answer this with corn in mind. Is there anything that points to A to storing grain for a rally in corn?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French Oh, I absolutely does. I mean, we're actually in a carry market in corn and and beans. First time that we've seen that here in a while. So, you know, we got about 70% sold. We're actually using this break that we've seen here off the summer highs to re own some of those bushels because we are looking for a postseason rally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager But absolutely, we're looking for prices to move higher here. I'll let either of you answer it with another commodity in mind. Would you store any wheat or soybeans? Go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub I'll just say yeah. I mean, I would store with with a bullish outlook. I mean, it's a speculation, but I would but I'll just make one comment that we are in a higher interest rate environment. And so now all of a sudden, storing and actually deferring that income matters in a way that it didn't matter a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Yeah, and I agree with Alan, it costs about $0.09 a month interest right now, $0.19 a bushel on interest to carry soybeans a month. I mean, so it's not like it was a year ago. So it's a big change, Paul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager So it's a different thing to think about now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Time is money. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager And that's I think I think that's only been starting. I think you all have started bringing that up here in the last, well, say 6 to 9 weeks and moving forward with interest rates. We don't know. CPI pie last week, PKI, there's a little hesitation. There's some thought the Fed might still raise interest rates higher. So does that change your answer at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose No, but I think what you're going to see is a producer pick up the selling pace on soybeans. But, you know, we're in a dangerous place right now as far as the soybeans, you know, believe in if it can move lower or higher. Typically, if you look at our market in the spring, it's hard to go lower because we have a lot of issues weather, this, that and the other thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that's where we're at with South America. Argentina is in a drought. It's a precarious situation with demand way under the market in China buying softer and wheat here lately, that's a big deal. You know, along with soybeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Well, Elaine, with with beans and the Chinese economy again this week, a couple of stories. It's still struggling. Chinese economy. What does that do for the person who just finished harvesting beans right now and what they should be doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Yeah, being being careful. And, you know, the one thing that we haven't touched on is the need for cash. I mean, some folks are going to need to sell one way or another just to raise some cash. But I want to pick up on what Don said about the Chinese wheat purchase. That was a big wheat purchase and it is a reflection, again, that this is not just a North American market, certainly not wheat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, it's the Australian drought. It's the drought going on in South America. All of these things are going to be able to move these markets wheat wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager You want to you want to do anything more on beans before we go back to wheat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French So I was going to just hit on wheat that, you know, it's not unheard of for China to buy U.S. wheat. I mean, they buy two or 300,000 metric tons per year. But now we've had purchases now three weeks in a row, and there there are triple normal amount of purchases right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it is a good sign. I mean, we're down here at 3 to 4 year lows. So hopefully it keeps going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager All right. That's the beauty of this panel. We can just go with anywhere except I have to think of the control room right now and get back on page. Let's go wheat. Elaine, for let's go. Let's start in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wheat wise, you mentioned finally a game. Finally, the last couple of weeks we've put on some positive news. Is this a blip or a trend?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub It might be a trend. And I think that that echoed sort of the thought of the larger sector. And I'm sorry to frustrate you and the control room, but now now I want to talk about like corn and soybeans and wheat altogether. So if China's buying China's pretty good at doing this marketing thing, you know, if they're getting in there and seeing these prices as a buying opportunities, and if everybody here at this table kind of feels pretty bullish about things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, if you are in a situation where you are an end user or certainly a livestock feeder, you've got to think about these potential lows or the long term potential for for bullish activity in the next few months. And look at these as buying opportunities like China is okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager I could tell I couldn't tell if you were both putting your heads up and down. Are you thinking we're bullish right now? Jeff?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French I'm not going to say bullish, but I mean, I'm just done being bearish. The wheat. I mean, they've thrown everything that this market right now. So I I'm if I'm short I got make sure that I got calls up above but I'm not sure down here for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well if you really look at these markets and that was the last report said it was a supply bullish market in a demand bearish market. So we need to reach a point to move higher. I mean, I think we've we've socked in low, you know, can we move how much higher is the question mark? And that's going to be dependent on the demand side of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's work in progress poll as there always is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Demand is the story in you know Alan wants to talk about three commodities that's the story in all of them right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Add in cotton to I think cotton the demand like that's where you start to see the global demand really starting to fall apart. And that's cotton's problem so far as yeah, global demand is struggling that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager So you're.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Saying more and more commodities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager They're following along. Fantastic in there. It's so cotton. Are you saying cotton has a demand issue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Yeah, I think I mean, I mean clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Yeah. But do you think then the other three grains that you mentioned are having, is the demand story positive or negative? Right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub I'm with Don. I'm I don't know. I don't know. I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Collingwood trends transitioning to we're not being so bearish I mean well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose The other thing that's going on is people interest rates are higher so people are more value conscious than they were before. In other words, you're not buying ahead and stockpiling because time is money. So I think that's part of what's going on. But China is still going to buy, what, 100 billion metric tons of soybeans. They're not leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a matter of who's going to fill that case. And that's going to be dependent on what happens in South America. Trust me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager South America, I believe I'm going to get my regions wrong. One is wet, one is dry. Which commodity is impacted the most with South America move?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, Argentina is in a drought right now and Australia is in a drought. So those two are wheat. Brazil is about 51% planted or 52% planted on the first corn crop and they're planting about 11% of the soybean crop right now. It's dry. You know, we work with some people there and they're saying it's not last year. Last year, they were getting timely rains.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year they're getting enough to maybe germinate in the north and then the south is too darn wet. Paul So it's it's this weather. We've seen it in the US and around the world. It's hit and miss and goes fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Okay. Jeff,\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French all eyes on Brazil, 112 million acres that they're expected to plant here this winter. You know, that will be the biggest thing that I hear what our fundamentals look at. I mean, 220 million bushels is tight, but now with a big crop down in Brazil. So all eyes there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager All right, let's wrap up with beans. Do you feel deferred?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look next year, March, April, May and planting. Are you doing any sales for 24 yet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, Don, anything more on beans for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, usually harvest isn't the best time to make new sales, Paul. Well, on the back to the soybeans in September, crop report were much tighter, yields probably going lower and we were the day of the September report, we were like 1342 for a low and 1372 for a high. So you can argue that we need to go up 70 to $0.80 just to get back to where we started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Yes. Lane Do you agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Yeah. But I will also say, I mean, it's never wrong to sell if it's profitable. And actually these are still technically profitable levels for a lot of folks. But I'll say one thing. Like Jeff mentioned, these prices, it'd be easier for folks to sell or to look years and ahead and start selling. If the prices sounded better. I mean, we just have such an anchor of the last couple of years when things were so much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, if you had said five years ago, you'd have a chance to sell 1250 beans or $5 corn, you'd be like, Oh yeah, sounds pretty good. But after last year's prices, now we're anchored so much higher and nobody wants to do it. So just, just a cautionary tale, just behaviorally to think about, you know, what is actually profitable and not just what was available six months ago or a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Anything else, Jeff? Beans, Corn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French I just yes, I second that if it's profitable, I would never tell you to not sell grain, but I would definitely follow it up with, you know, some ownership on paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Okay, Let's move to livestock a little bit. Are we good on that? Can I. I'll try to get consensus of the table here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most, I think, out of control I think I've ever had this one. This is incredible. I love it. Don. Let's look at cattle, because that seems to be a tiny bit out of control with with with things that aren't normally talked about in the cattle market. It almost looks like it's a technical movement. Now. Do you concur?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, you know, we've got everybody's in the same camp. You know, Paul, it's a cyclical bull market. We haven't had that since 12, 13, 14. And so the trade wants to be bullish for another two years. I don't think it's that. I think it's back to the the demand side of the market. You know, like we always say, nothing's enough if nobody wants it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at what price? You know, we were sputtering right here. Now, seasonally on cattle, you're supposed to buy cattle basically Friday until the first week of November. And it's just the opposite of the hogs, you know, supposed to sell them. So you're in a little seasonal up on cattle, down on hogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Elaine, what do you think about technical fundamental movements in cattle market right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub I will defer to Don that, but I'll say that cash market this week was hot, hot, hot. I mean, it was up 2 to $3 this week to 92 dressed, 185 live. I mean, we're in a position now where record high beef prices at the retail grocery store level. And it's just a question of whether or not we can make record high actual cash prices for those Fed cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Are we to the point at the consumer is going to step away from beef?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French We're not there yet, but I think it's it's soon. I mean, you had the former CEO of Walmart come out this week and say in the first time in a decade, the consumer is starting to buckle. So the consumer is starting to tight their belt.\n",
      "\n",
      "And obviously with beef prices where they are, there are much cheaper alternatives. So I think that will that will break the back. How far we go down from there, we'll have to see. But it has it's not happening yet, but I think it happens pretty smart pretty soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager What do you think about the feeder market then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French Big correction, We've come down here to support, you know, rallying back with the corn going higher. You know, these are expensive, expensive feeder cattle. If you're filling up the pen, we're just advising that you make sure you have downside protection locked in because 25, $30 move in feeders is not too big at these prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Let's ask the cattle feeder at the table. You fill in the pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub I don't I don't feed cattle, but I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager You have to play along with the that talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub To Don.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager About I know he's got a few.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub but yeah no I mean I think we're looking at a fall run where again we're going to be setting maybe some record high prices which can, which can be possible. I mean, I think folks can make it work for quality level or certain, you know, for certain plays. But 250 feeder cattle, I mean, that's what we're going to see as as we start to see these calves come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Well, and I was I was looking in back to lower levels. I think the chart doesn't quite go back far enough. But, Don, July lows, we were we were close to that this week. Right on on feeders that we've dipped back down. Do you think we're at a crossroads here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, you know, the thing about the feeder cattle, I mean, the numbers just aren't there, Paul. I think it was pretty impressive that the feeder cattle went up with the corn going up. So I think we have a floor there just from the numbers. And I don't think it's so much that I think is what happens to corn and then what happens with those defer hedge able opportunities and those are work in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's going to be tough for April cattle next year to go over 200. We tried and it's just a tough number, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager What about in the hog market this week? You know, you look at a sell off again and again. It has just been up and down. Where are we headed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, the hog market's in huge liquidation. I mean, the Packers making about $32 a head, the vertical hog integrators losing about $20 a head. We've been in this massive liquidation and eventually, Paul, the liquidation should translate to higher prices next year. But the government says about 85 for all and next year we're substantially higher than that. But December hogs run in a $12 discount to the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Right now it's normally on par so upfront little cheap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Elaine anything else on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Hogs just exactly that is seasonally that that the futures market is looking at heading down towards December probably bottoming out there at some point and then hopefully recovering. But yeah I think in the near term there's not a lot of hopeful signals from the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager I want to get to crude oil for a minute, Jeff, what's going on in Israel, in Iran, in Gaza, in this area? Initially, there was this call that we were going to have $150 oil didn't come to fruition yet. Then the week progressed. How do you navigate what's happening globally and understanding what that means for us on the farm?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff French Yeah, we came in Sunday, we spiked higher. We actually traded crude oil, traded lower all four days until Friday. You saw short covering come in. Nobody wants to be short. Crude oil going into the weekend because of the absolute uncertainty. I would just tell my clients that, you know, you put some call options up above here. If this thing wants to run another 15, $20 higher, you know, that is a great hedge to stay in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it's certainly part of it is out of our control. But what we can and control is if it wants to move higher, that call option can appreciate in value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Elaine Do you see anything from what's happened this week globally that we need to be paying attention to in a market other than crude?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub No, and I think it's really interesting from the crude oil market. Exactly. Is, you know, I talked about an efficient market. If that market is really expressing the outlook of what is truly going to happen, it's been remarkably quiet and calm, which would suggest that it might, you know, the all the violence might be sort of contained in a certain region and not and not bring in everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, I don't know. We don't know. Nobody knows. But if the market knows, then so far we're okay. But yeah, you got to be you got to be aware and you got to keep your eye on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Don, Is there one commodity that you were watching this week with the eye of what was happening?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Roose Well, I mean, I think if you look at it now, you've got issues in the Black Sea in the Middle East. And I think the problem with the livestock market in the grains on Friday was everybody just wanted to get back to home base. I mean, there's something's going to happen probably over the weekend, you know, in the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we'll see what it is. But very interesting situation. A lot of I've seen one like that in my years of trading. All right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager Let's close with this. We have one question that I want to bring in. I want to look ahead. I want to look to Scott in Wisconsin's question that he submitted to us for your Facebook. This is looking to 24, Jeff. You already had one of those. So, Elaine, I'll start with you. What commodity do you see having the highest upside in 2024?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elaine Kub Hmm. Great trick question. I you know any of them. But, but let's say corn even because I think there is so much potential for for the supply and demand under the understanding of that supply and demand picture to change. So from a percentage basis, I think a lot of the other commodities really haven't fallen apart in the way that our, you know, our core proxy corn has. And I think there is a lot of potential for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager John, what do you like in 24?\n",

      "Don Roose I'd say soybeans have the upside potential in South America as a problem, but there's going to be a huge acre switch from soybeans to of corn into soybeans. In South America. Corn acres are production is going to be down about 700 million versus last year and beans up 200 million. So I think that's a prelude to what happens here in the U.S. But I'd keep my eye on soybeans just because it doesn't take them a lot to move the needle.\n",

      "\n",
      "Jeff French you know, corn and wheat down here at multi-year lows? You know, I'll go with corn, but at the same time, you got to look at what we did in 23. I mean, look how short we were on rainfall. And look at the yields that we are seeing. I mean, it's it's not a record crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's, you know, eight bushels below trend line. But those timely rains have produced a very good corn crop. And while it was very hot here in the United States, so I'd be careful on betting up to the topside, but we'll go with corn here. Right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Yeager The only thing, though, that could be is we had some rain last fall that helped set us up in 23. Not sure we'll get that. We'll see how that forecast works out.

      "September was a rough month in the stock market, as the S&P 500 fell 4.9%. But investors can gain an advantage by understanding the forces that drove certain stocks higher or lower. You can prepare yourself for upcoming market trends by digging deeper beyond the headlines. It's always a good idea to review key trends to ensure that your portfolio allocation is aligned with long-term goals and short-term drivers. These four stocks had major moves last month that illustrate some of the important forces that are influencing the market right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Target\n",
      "\n",
      "Target (TGT -0.53%) shares slumped by 12.6% in September thanks to a number of gloomy macroeconomic indicators and headlines. The monthly retail sales data showed weakness in consumer goods, especially automobiles and other durables. Transaction data released by payment processors also suggested a pullback in household spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "That all coincided with an unexpected slowdown in new housing starts, which is a strongly negative indicator of consumer confidence. It's taken a long time, but high interest rates are finally translating to clear signs of consumer strain. Consumer budgets are tightening as a softening job market is combining with inflation, expensive borrowing costs, and higher lending standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "That flurry of shaky economic data came on the heels of a tough quarterly earnings season for consumer stocks and retailers. Target was one of several large retailers that published disappointing financial results and gloomy forward-looking commentary in August. Top-line stagnation combined with profit margin compression to paint an ugly picture for cash flows over the next few quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Target was probably the highest-profile casualty of this trend, but there were several others that shared the drop. Dollar General and Dollar Tree both moved lower as investors grew concerned about their profit margins. Walmart stock held up much better, thanks to its ability to manage through weak periods, but it still dropped. A handful of retailers and consumer stocks were spared losses, but it's an overall bearish signal for the economy as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Boeing\n",
      "\n",
      "Boeing (BA 0.01%) was another conspicuously weak performer in September, along with several of its major airline customers. The aircraft manufacturer provided forward-looking commentary at an investor conference that caused investors to doubt the company's ability to meet its previous forecasts for the full year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boeing sells low volumes of extremely high-cost items to customers that are highly sensitive to economic cycles. Boeing itself has high fixed costs and a debt-heavy balance sheet that that pulls more than $10 billion of cash out of the company in the form of interest and principal repayments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boeing also has almost $80 billion worth of inventory on its balance sheet, which can quickly become less liquid during tough times. These factors make the aerospace stock exceptionally sensitive to economic cycles and interest rates, and September's major economic news suggested that we should expect high interest rates and weak aggregate demand for multiple quarters to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major airlines obviously have a different business model from Boeing, but they share some of the same characteristics and key business drivers. September's price charts for major airlines United, Delta, Southwest, and American Airlines were strikingly similar to one another and to Boeing last month, illustrating the powerful market forces that dictate performance for these sorts of companies. Debt-laden cyclical stocks are likely to remain volatile over the next few quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Nvidia\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia's (NVDA 1.40%) 12% dip in September wasn't as extreme as some other stocks', but it exerts a ton of pressure on index performance with its trillion-dollar market cap. Semiconductor stocks struggled last month, thanks to growing concerns that demand is weaker than previously forecast, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) applications that have been fueling the sector's returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Losses among growth stocks and the tech sector outpaced the market average last month. The Nasdaq Composite index, which is generally heavier on tech and growth stocks, fell 5.8% in September, nearly a full percentage point more than the S&P. The pain was especially bad after the Fed's announcement that interest rates are likely to remain high for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investor risk tolerance deteriorated in September, making it tough for stocks with lofty valuation ratios like Nvidia. The semiconductor powerhouse is the most glaring example of a wider market trend that points to overall bearish sentiment for the time being. Growth investors need to maintain a long-term strategy and prepare for volatility in the short term.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Dell\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side of the coin, Dell (DELL -0.41%) showed investors that there's still room for optimism in the stock market. Dell crushed Wall Street's revenue forecasts, and reported an upbeat outlook for the next year. That was in contrast to a gloomy report from its rival, HP, which had dampened expectations for all companies in the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dell's better-than-expected results and explicit focus on the opportunities created by AI were the fuel necessary for the stock to break free of broader market trends, soaring 22.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dell rose after reporting earnings, it capitalized on investor hype around AI, and it was bouncing back from previously lowered expectations. These were a very specific set of circumstances that caused the stock to overcome macro headwinds. While it won't always be that combination of catalysts, investors should still recognize that returns can be generated when companies report unexpected good news and stock valuations are reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market might be volatile over the next few months, but it's not all doom and gloom. Stay allocated for long-term growth.\n",

      "\n",
      "City Manager Sam Sanders’ Friday announcement that the park will resume its previous operating hours of 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Oct. 21 means the homeless men and women who have been living in an encampment there for the past three weeks must find other shelter or risk being kicked out or cited for trespassing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders lifted the curfew at the park after Charlottesville residents reported to City Council that police had mistreated at least two homeless men at the park. Since then, 35 tents have been erected there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of those living at the park today have said they have no intention of leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darnell Burton, who said he was among a small group that discreetly resided at the park even before the curfew was lifted, vowed to fight back and keep his tent up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burton told The Daily Progress on Friday afternoon that the city doesn’t have the legal authority to exile the park’s tenants.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Show me in the Code of Virginia where you can’t have tents when the park is open,” he said. “We’re going to stay here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s in spite of the fact that the city has said its decision to reinstate the park’s prior operating hours was made because additional overnight beds would be made available for the homeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "People and Congregations Engaged in Ministry, or PACEM, announced Thursday it would be opening its overnight shelter operations early this year. The group has operated an emergency shelter during the coldest months of the year in Charlottesville since 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our regular open was scheduled for Oct 28,” Liz Yohn, PACEM operations manager, told The Daily Progress on Friday. “Our season will now run Oct 21-Apr 12.”\n",
      "\n",
      "PACEM has 50 beds between two sites, Yohn said, and provides those accommodations and other resources in partnership with the city, Charlottesville First United Methodist Church, the Salvation Army and Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness , or PATH, a federal, state and local partnership that provides outreach and assistance to adults with serious mental illness who are experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of becoming homeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We meet folks where they are,” PACEM board Chair Cliff Haury said in a Thursday statement, “and we adapt to what they need. Right now, they’re in the park and need shelter — that’s something we already know how to address.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The city said it will be reimposing the curfew at the park to coincide with PACEM’s early opening on Oct. 21.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The City of Charlottesville will resume operating hours in Market Street Park at 11:00 pm the same day,” the city said in its Friday statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city added that there are also beds available at the Salvation Army shelter on Ridge Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Salvation Army told The Daily Progress on Friday it had four available beds at its shelter in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are four here,” Brenda Smith, Salvation Army shelter manager, said. “One on the men and three on the women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Echoing Yohn’s remarks, Smith said her organization would be working closely with PACEM once it opens on Oct. 21.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will be obliging them with 16 additional people to house. Eight for the men, eight for the women,” Smith said. “They won’t have a bed, but they will be in the lounge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders said the city will continue to engage with groups that provide resources, including shelter, to the homeless population in Charlottesville as the park resumes normal hours and the men and women there move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have asked our staff to engage with various service providers to strategize ways we can support this process so that anyone in the park will receive the assistance that they need to ensure a smooth transition. This work has already begun and will continue through whatever period necessary,” Sanders said in his Friday statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Daily Progress reached out to Ashley Marshall, deputy city manager, for clarity on what other service providers the city is working with but did not receive a response by press time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders decided to lift the curfew at the park three weeks ago after residents reported to City Council that at least two homeless men at the park had been mistreated by the city’s police — one kicked and another arrested for trespassing — and that officers were intentionally targeting the Black population at the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "After hearing what he called the “disgusting and disturbing actions” alleged of his officers, Charlottesville Police Chief Michael Kochis launched an internal investigation that found those reports were groundless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has been determined that the allegations that our officers have been targeting Black, unhoused individuals with violence, and that officers have only been asking Black, unhoused individuals to leave the park, are unfounded and simply did not occur,” Kochis said at a Sept. 28 press conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reviewing bodycam footage, Kochis determined that a homeless man sleeping on the ground at the park after the 11 p.m. curfew the night of Sept. 16 had not been kicked; he described the contact made between an officer’s foot and the man a “touch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bodycam footage of the Sept. 12 arrest of Roscoe Boxley at the park shows the man sitting in a chair on one of the park’s walkways, fully aware that he is about to violate the 11 p.m. curfew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t got nowhere to go. Nowhere at all. Everywhere we’ve been y’all have ran us off,” Boxley says to the officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "One officer asks if Boxley had tried finding a bed at the Salvation Army.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think I’d be out here if I could get into Salvation Army?” Boxley asks. “You’re going to lock me up right now because I ain’t going nowhere, and the only way I’m going somewhere is if you lock me up. I’m going to be heard one way or another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At 11 p.m., Boxley stood from his chair and immediately put his hands behind his back, waiting to be arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of people in Charlottesville who have fallen into homelessness has grown by 25% since 2018, according to the Blue Ridge Area Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates and leads collaborative efforts to address homelessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Sept. 28 press conference, Kochis suggested that at the root of the homeless crisis in Charlottesville is not the police response to a park curfew but the resources available to those in need.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m just going to be frank. I’m sorry, but I’ve worked in two other jurisdictions, the city of Alexandria and the town of Warrenton,” he said. “Both had a 24-hour shelter with wraparound services, and I’ve never been in a jurisdiction that hasn’t had either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly across the street from Market Street Park sits the Haven, a homeless resource center in the former First Christian Church which has been in operation since 2010. But the Haven only provides shelter services during the daytime, and the city prohibits it from operating at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Executive Director Anna Mendez told The Daily Progress that while the city has indicated a willingness to reconsider that decision, it is still in the very early stages of that conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be incredibly premature to put any type of timeline on it,” Mendez said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Haven announced it will be hosting a “Housing First & Homelessness” event Nov. 13.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you grappled with the questions, ‘Are there evidence-based solutions to homelessness? What are we doing locally to end homelessness, and what challenges do we face in implementing these efforts in our community?’ If so, join us Monday,” an invitation to the event reads.\n",

      "Stronger-than-expected job creation in the US, renewed doubts about inflation, the start of the earnings season, and geopolitical fallout from events in the Middle East. These factors have moved financial markets in recent days – but not necessarily as one might have expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "US labour market – Job creation rebounds\n",
      "\n",
      "Net job creation in September and upward revisions to the data for the previous two months have raised a big question: is there a slowdown in the US labour market? Non-farm payrolls came in at 336 000 in September – almost double the expected 180 000. Third-quarter monthly net job creation averaged 266 000, well above the second quarter’s 201 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ household survey was less favourable, showing a stable unemployment rate at 3.8% (up from 3.5% in July) and a slight fall in job leavers at 12.7% of unemployed persons (down from 15.8% a year earlier). A high level for this indicator suggests employees are confident that jobs are plentiful meaning they could easily switch from one job to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slowdown in the pace of wage increases (see Exhibit 1) appears to be part of the same trend: the labour market is gradually becoming less favourable to employees as supply and demand rebalance slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the prospect of the labour market normalising explain the correction after the initial knee-jerk reaction that sent the yield of the 10-year Treasury note spiralling to above 4.85% and the 30-year yield to 5.05% in the wake of the job report’s release on Friday 6 October?\n",
      "\n",
      "It could be so. But US bond market positioning adjustments before a three-day weekend may also have played a part. And the attack on Israel on 7 October prompted a flight-to-safety, benefiting government bonds at the expense of equities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really – ‘at the expense of equities’? Then what about the 3.2% increase in the MSCI AC World index in US dollar terms in the week that straddled those events, 4-11 October?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavlov’s markets\n",
      "\n",
      "Market observers are used to the market’s occasional bout of ‘bad news is good news’ contrariness, when bad economic news is greeted by a rise in equities (or vice versa).\n",
      "\n",
      "We are probably currently faced with another, equally specious type of reasoning: ‘a fall in bond yields (for whatever reason) leads to a rise in equities’.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the latest theory to join the club of circular reasoning the rise in long-term bond yields tightens financial conditions, which means that the US Federal Reserve may (or even must) respond by loosening monetary policy. Even if that seems logical, it’s not necessarily the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a speech on 9 October, Fed Vice-Chair Phillip Jefferson illustrated the dilemma that the Fed will face in the coming months. Suggesting that the recent rise in real yields is a consequence of a stronger-than-expected economy that requires keeping monetary policy tighter for longer, he said: ‘I am also mindful that increases in real yields can arise from changes in investors’ attitudes toward risk and uncertainty. Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields as I assess the future path of policy’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is inflation going?\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest inflation news has been encouraging, showing a widespread slowdown of both core inflation and services prices. While some upside surprises remain possible, the dynamics of price increases have changed dramatically from 2022 and early 2023, raising hopes of an – albeit slow – return of inflation to central banks’ targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund devoted a chapter in its most recent World Economic Outlook report to the role of short-term inflation expectations on actual inflation dynamics. It appears to us that one of its key conclusions is that ‘improvements in monetary policy frameworks and communications can help lower the output costs needed to reduce inflation and inflation expectations, making it more likely the central bank can achieve a soft landing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest European Central Bank (ECB) consumer expectations survey found that, despite monetary policy tightening since July 2022, households anticipate inflation at 3.5% over the next 12 months (median point) with a wide dispersion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minutes of the September US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed that a growing number of members are concerned about tightening financial conditions. They consider it important to ‘balance [the] risk of overtightening against [that] of insufficient tightening’ and that their discussions should now focus on ‘how long’ policy should be kept restrictive, rather than ‘how high’ policy rates should rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "This roadmap implies that the Fed will ‘proceed carefully’ in the short term, with official rates likely on hold in November, but no rapid cuts after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are bonds going?\n",
      "\n",
      "Explaining the upward pressure on long-term bond yields in September (+46bp on the US 10-year T-note yield; +37bp on the German Bund 10-year yield; +66bp on the Italian BTP yield) and early October is a tough task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it a temporary phenomenon linked to adjustments in investor positions in this new transition period (end of the tightening cycle, revisions to market expectations of rapid policy rate cuts in 2024)? Or is it a reaction to a resilient US economy, with the usual contagion effect on European bond markets?\n",
      "\n",
      "What cannot yet be ruled out is that the deterioration in bond yields in the third quarter stemmed from some investors seeking to obtain a better risk premium in the middle of uncertainty, as the Fed Vice Chair pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the growth outlook in the coming quarters, in our view the consensus seems a little too optimistic, ignoring the risk of a slowdown in activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without even taking into account the specific risks in the US (auto workers’ strikes, end of the freeze on the repayment of student loans), a slowdown would normally be the ‘natural’ consequence of the brutal monetary tightening since 2022, whose effects seem to be delayed in this cycle compared to the past. The fact is, parts of the US economy such as the housing market are starting to suffer from rising interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, we decided to keep our overweight position in the fixed income pockets of our diversified portfolios. Volatility may remain high in the short term, not only for technical reasons, but also because finding consensus in assessing the likelihood of the various possible scenarios is difficult.\n",

      "\n",
      "For quite a while the gaming market was considered by some to be an evergreen industry that thrives regardless of the worldwide economic situation.\n",

      "\n",
      "And it's no wonder such beliefs were common, as the videogames market has been growing for the last 30 years, performing relatively well even during the tough 2007-2008 crisis. In 2020, not the best time for many sectors, the revenues of video game companies increased by 23.1% (Newzoo).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, everything changed when 2022 hit the world. According to data.ai, the size of the video game industry in 2022 amounted to $193 billion, a 5% decrease from the 2021 figures. Another \"novelty\" was that the leader of the fall was the mobile games segment which comprised more than half of the overall gaming industry and declined by almost 7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison, the decrease in the console games revenue was 3.4%, while that of the PC games was just 1%. But what could possibly go wrong in a market that has been blossoming for more than a decade and that was not (or at least not dramatically) impacted by significant economic declines? Let's dive into the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile has lost a bit of momentum\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened to the mobile games market in 2022\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last decade, the mobile sector has been a key driver of the video game industry's growth. However, as I've already mentioned, 2022 puts a pause on the mobile gaming industry's previous rapid expansion. Here are some of the factors that affected the market's decline in 2022:\n",
      "\n",
      "Change in players' payment behaviour that might be associated with a decrease in disposable income. On the graph from data.ai, we can observe that disposable income and consumer spending in games in the USA behave very similarly and a drop in the former starting from Q2'2021 is aligned with a decrease in the latter. This likely affected return on investment models of mobile publishers, making them more conservative and targeting shorter timelines for seeing a return on their investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disposable Income and Spend in Games, USA (State of Mobile Gaming Report 2023, data.ai) Growing competition for players' attention with short video services and streaming services. The choice for the mobile audience is not only which game to play, but also whether to play or to spend time in other apps. And their choice often seems to fall on short video services that in 2022 accounted for 17% of all mobile time spent. One of the most popular ones is TikTok, which surpassed one billion MAU (monthly average users) in September 2021. It's worth mentioning that streaming services as a whole are a significant competitor, being the No. 1 category of non-gaming apps by downloads and revenue in 2022 (according to data.ai).\n",
      "\n",
      "A long-term effect of Apple's IDFA depreciation. Currently, only 45% of iOS customers opt for tracking which results in an associated change in the way publishers manage User Acquisition, as older higher-spending cohorts that consist of well-targeted players were replaced with less-targeted and less monetized ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased competition within genres resulted in the game quality bar and the cost of user acquisition rising significantly, making it extremely complicated for new games to break through.\n",
      "\n",
      "These issues have affected not only small and medium-sized studios but also large players who find it increasingly difficult to launch new games in the changed market environment. From the headlines, we know that EA cancelled mobile Apex Legends and Battlefield games and Playtika suspended its new game launches until the marketing landscape improves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even large players have found it increasingly difficult to launch new games in the changed market environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we've discussed the preconditions, let's consider the consequences (the data) in more detail. We've analyzed the evolution of mobile market trends on a subgenre basis by creating custom models based on data.ai featuring the changes in the key genres and subgenres according to data.ai taxonomy year by year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: Please note that all the data we provide regarding the market size, the size of the genres, and the size of specific regions is based on our model (if not stated otherwise). In the model, we rely on the data.ai taxonomy. The revenues of markets, genres, subgenres, and specific titles were obtained from data.ai. data.ai always works on improving its data, which is why the numbers we show in this article might be different from the numbers currently shown by data.ai (as, unfortunately, we cannot constantly update this text). Also, note that we only consider the revenue generated by paid downloads and/or in-app revenue net of 30% platform commission that goes to the iOS and Google Play stores. We do not account for revenue generated outside the app stores, such as advertising and e-commerce.

      "My.Games breaks down the 2022 mobile market by genre and subgenre\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, you might have heard that the global mobile gaming market dropped by 7% in 2022, but let's break that down a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "RPG, Strategy, and Match genres that were the leaders by revenue (and together comprised more than half of the market) all decreased by more than 5%. The drop in the RPG sector was mainly caused by the poor performance of the Team Battles subgenre, the revenue of which dropped by 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the Strategy genre itself did not perform so well, it is significant to highlight the Auto Chess subgenre that increased by more than 20% with TFT China being the key revenue driver. The Merge subgenre (which is a part of the Match genre in our analysis) also posted growth of more than 20%, with Merge Mansion and Merge County being among the leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the overall industry environment was pessimistic, some genres managed to show good results\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the overall industry environment was pessimistic, some genres managed to show good results. The revenue of Action games increased by 21% thanks to the strengthening of the MOBAs. One of the key revenue drivers there was Honor of Kings. The Party genre also increased, though less significantly (by 8%). An honorable mention in the genre is, of course, goes to the Stumble Guys game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have a clearer picture of what was going on in different genres, it's time to talk about regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western markets (Tier-1: USA, Germany, France, Great Britain, etc.) accounted for $25 billion in revenue and comprised 44% of the global industry. With a 12% drop in 2022, the Western region was one of the key drivers of the global mobile gaming industry decline. Top-3 genres in the region by revenue volume were Match ($4.7 billion), Strategy ($4.5 billion), and Casino ($4.1 billion) which decreased by 5%, 12%, and 10% respectively. RPG revenue also declined by 12%, while Party was the only genre that had positive dynamics showing an 8% growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Asia (not including China), the situation was similar - the mobile gaming market dropped by 10% getting down to $16.9 billion. Unlike the worldwide trend, in Asia, the Party games' revenue decreased by 37%, although the Party games segment is very small in this region with only $96m in in-app revenue in 2022. In general, all the genres faced a decline apart from Casino ($707m) and Action ($619m) games, which increased by 13% and 7% respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emerging markets (i.e. South America, Turkey, etc.) comprise less than 5% of the global mobile gaming market with $2.7 billion of in-app revenue in 2022, though mobile gaming in these regions had much more positive dynamics. The mobile gaming industry in emerging markets increased by 5% in 2022 with most of the genres supporting this growth. The growth leaders in these regions were Party ($137m) and Match ($225m) games that increased by 50% and 16% respectively. However, not all genres were flourishing in emerging markets in 2022. The revenue of RPG ($553m), Sports ($108m), and Racing ($21m) games decreased by 6%, 2%, and 12% respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, it's important to highlight that China is a huge part of the worldwide mobile gaming market. On iOS, the in-app revenue of mobile games in China in 2022 was $10.8 billion, which is a 19% increase compared to 2021. However, as we do not have the data on the Android performance in this region, a detailed analysis would not be meaningful, as Android stores play a significant role in this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, that was lots of data, but it was essential to dive into the figures to get the whole picture. But what's going on in 2023? (Attention: a bit more data is arriving).\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the results of the first half of 2023, we can say that the market has reached a plateau. In its latest report, Newzoo predicts the mobile gaming market to rise by 0.8% in 2023, which is not a lot, but an increase after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to our model that is based on the data.ai data (don't forget about the disclaimer while looking at the figures), the results of the first half of 2023 show that the market has decreased by 1% compared to the first half of 2022 and is currently estimated to be $28.7 billion (once again, it's a figure for half a year).\n",
      "\n",
      "Party games continue growing, showing more than a 60% increase compared to the first half of 2022\n",
      "\n",
      "Party games continue growing, showing more than a 60% increase compared to the first half of 2022, with Eggy Party and Monopoly Go being among the key growth drivers. By the way, Monopoly Go deserves an honorable mention, as this fresh release has gained strong positions on the Luck Battle market that has been historically dominated by the Coin Master. It even managed to outperform Coin Master (what seemed to be nearly impossible for quite a while) in terms of in-app revenue in August 2023, according to data.ai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Match games recovered from a drop in 2022 and have earned $3.5 billion in the first half of 2023, even exceeding the figures of the first half of 2021 mainly due to the outstanding performance of the Gardenscapes, Royal Match, and the Candy Crash titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the positive dynamics of the Party and Match genres, the continuing decline in the revenue of RPG, Shooting, and Strategy games (they decreased by 3%, 22%, and 13% respectively) prevents the mobile gaming market from getting back on its growing track. However, there are some very interesting releases in 2023 in these genres that are worth mentioning. One of them is, of course, Honkai: Star Rail from the Genshin Impact developer MiHoYo. The game was released in April 2023 and shows impressive performance on mobile (which is not that much of a surprise, to be honest). Another promising release is White Out Survival, a survival strategy game that made its way to the top-20 strategy games by in-app revenue in H1 2023 according to data.ai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons for investment share decline in the gaming industry\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's take a look at the investment environment in the games industry based on the data from InvestGame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investment deals grew with the pandemic, both in the number of deals and the size of them\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of transactions and the volume of investments in the gaming industry was set at a certain level. Everything changed with the onset of the pandemic — many industries had to tighten up. As a result, investors – including institutional ones – drew their attention to games. This brought a large amount of investment into the gaming industry from venture investors, strategic holdings, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"feast\" lasted until mid-2022, after which the Western markets slowed down. As a result, investors became much more careful and conservative. We see that in Q3 and Q4 of last year, the volume of investments significantly dropped along with a decrease in the volume of transactions. Q1 and Q2 of 2023 have also been on a downfall, however, the results of Q3 are about to be significantly different probably not by the number of deals, but definitely by their size, as Savvy Games Group closed its acquisition of Scopely for $4.9 billion in July and the acquisition of Rovio by Sega for approximately $775 million closed in mid- August.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, we can conclude that investors are still active, but they are now much more cautious. They have significantly raised their expectations regarding the companies and projects in which they are ready to invest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me elaborate a bit more on the reasons behind the drop in the volume of the late-stage and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) transactions at the beginning of 2023. Late-stage means investments in already established businesses, when there is a new spark for their growth, and M&A is when the ownership of the entity is transferred to or consolidated with another company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of late-stage transactions has decreased because investors find it more complicated to further monetize their investments in a turbulent market. Considering M&A, shareholders of companies that have seen high valuations in a hot market are not ready to sell their shares at much lower prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, there are fewer strategic investors and less buyers' activity, because everyone is careful with their money, and can no longer participate in the bull run for higher multipliers and valuations. Now buyers are more inclined to deeply dissect the targets and really understand the underlying synergies and benefits for the business that comes as a result of the M&A. However, the examples of Scopely and Rovio deals give hope that the videogames M&A market is about to revive and to return if not to the activity levels of 2020-2021, but to the pre-pandemic figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, 2022 has opened a new chapter in the history of the mobile gaming industry. Indeed, it brought its difficulties, and many teams, both small and big ones, had to reconsider their strategies and future plans. However, these unsettling times have also opened lots of opportunities. There are many talented developers all over the world, and I believe that we all, as the mobile gaming industry, will learn the lessons of the past year and will find new ways to create even better games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just don't forget the basics: the foundation of a successful product is always a fun gameplay and an exciting gaming experience that make players return to your game.\n",

      "Investors love bull markets. A bull market means the stock market is rising, which is what stock investing is all about, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a bit simplistic, and there are reasons why investors should embrace bear markets when prices aren't rising so quickly too. Here's why.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantages of a bull market\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the primary purposes of investing is to grow your wealth. However, success in investing usually is the result of remaining invested over a long period of time. Stocks that appreciate thousands of percentage points -- or more -- do so over long periods, not overnight, and most definitely not in one year. However, most of their growth happens during bull markets, when the market is optimistic and everyone is buying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside of a bull market is that valuations can become very high quickly, constraining buying opportunities. Eventually stock prices fall back, but great stocks rarely lose all of their gains. Even when they lose a massive amount, they typically gain it back, and more, when a bull market returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantages of a bear market\n",
      "\n",
      "There are varying definitions of a bear market, but one of the more standard ones is when the market decreases 20% from its previous high. It doesn't get back to a bull market until it surpasses its previous high. Last year we entered a bear market, and although the S&P 500 is up 12% this year and has been even higher, we are still officially in a bear market. You can see from this chart when the market began to climb after crashing in 2020 and stayed elevated until last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "When stocks are down in a bear market, that's the time to buy. One of Warren Buffett's most famous quotes is \"We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.\" That's because when others are greedy, prices go up and often hit unsustainable levels. Drops are almost inevitable. Bear markets, when valuations deflate, correct prices and are prime stocking up opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one likes to see the value of their portfolios decline, but bear markets provide a window to leverage the decreases and maximize opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use both to your advantage\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many different approaches to investing. One of them is a \"set and forget\" mentality. If you evaluate a company and determine that it's a worthwhile investment, you can buy the stock and more or less move on for decades. While this could result in some losses, it also shields you from the anxiety and fear that could accompany frequent or daily stock checks. There are bound to be ups and downs, bull and bear markets, black swan events and more throughout your investing journey. Great businesses will weather all kinds of storms and reward you eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you take a more hands-on investing approach, where you buy and sell more regularly, you'll do your best investing when you make your decisions based on the company itself and not on external factors. Instead of ignoring the external environment, you can use it to your advantage by leaning into what the market can provide for you. In bear markets, it will be buying great stocks at low prices. That is likely to require being able to see the bigger picture. Some examples of excellent stocks at low prices, but with excellent free cash flow generated by the underlying business, to buy today are Home Depot, which is trading at a valuation of 18 times trailing 12-month earnings, or close to a 3-year low, and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 45, or near half its five-year average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've identified the top stocks for your portfolio, part of the process is ignoring the noise in the background. What you don't want to do is panic sell when prices go down. It doesn't matter if we're in a bear market or a bull market; hold on to great stocks through thick and thin, and you're likely to come out on top.\n",

      "“These proposed capacity market reforms will help PJM do what we do best – operating markets that attract critical investment in the resources we need to keep the lights on,” added Keech. “Maintaining enough resources that can support reliability are crucial to PJM’s ability to serve demand through the transition to a less carbon-intensive grid.” PJM recognizes stakeholder interest in continuing targeted collaboration on additional market enhancements, including a more granular approach to the capacity market, and will engage with stakeholders in pursuing these areas through various stakeholder venues.\n",

      "MSCI Inc’s benchmark for developing-nation equities slipped to begin the week as Israel’s retaliation against attacks by Hamas sparked fears of a broader conflict between the US and Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "That took the gauge, as of Monday’s close, to the weakest-ever level relative to the S&P 500 Index in data going back to 1987. The ratio has since recovered, with the emerging-market benchmark adding 2.3% in the past two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Investors need to look beyond the benchmark index given the 30% China weight, as emerging-market performance ex-China has done much better than the index alone indicates,” said Jitania Kandhari, deputy chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “Selective countries in EM are doing well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Broad emerging-market benchmarks have faced several headwinds this year, with the latest selloff in shares since July wiping out $1.8 trillion of shareholder wealth. The MSCI gauge erased all of its 2023 gains last month and is little changed for the year, compared with a 14% rally in the S&P 500.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drop has come as traders bet that higher-for-longer interest rates in the US lead to further dollar strength, keeping pressure on riskier assets. China’s stumbling economy has also been central to recent underperformance, especially as the nation’s companies account for roughly a third of the broad emerging-market gauge.\n",

      "The Robinhood trading platform helped introduce fee-free trading when it debuted in 2015, and the platform remains popular because of its easy-to-use app that even allows investors to buy fractional shares. That has allowed people who don't have a lot of capital the chance to invest in blue-chip companies that might otherwise be trading at per-share prices that are too high for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The platform has also been blamed for the rise of meme stocks. And another big shortcoming is that it doesn't offer investors the ability to buy mutual funds or individual bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Robinhood 100 list -- which features the most widely owned stocks in its members' portfolios -- doesn't always have all the best stocks to invest in, but they are certainly popular ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two stocks on the list that stand out for me in terms of their potential to beat the market over the next year or so are Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX 3.68%) and Realty Income (O 0.30%). The first is a fast-rising pharmaceutical company, and the other is a steady real estate investment trust (REIT) that has a remarkable reputation for raising its dividend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its potential, Catalyst is underpriced\n",
      "\n",
      "Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' shares are down 31% so far this year, despite the biopharmaceutical company being en route to its biggest year for revenue and earnings. The company focuses on rare diseases, and has been able to finance the development of its current candidates because of the sales success of Firdapse, the drug for treating Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), an autoimmune disorder that leads to muscle weakness. More than half of LEMS patients also develop small-cell lung cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second quarter, the company reported record revenue of $99.5 million, up 87.5% year over year. While Firdapse brought in $64.9 million of that (up 22% over the same period last year), the company is seeing good sales from Fycompa, an epileptic antiseizure drug that it purchased the U.S. rights to from Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai on Jan. 25 for $160 million. Last year, Eisai reported that it expected $136 million in Fycompa sales in fiscal 2022, and for 2023, Catalyst is predicting $130 million in revenue from the drug in slightly less than a year of sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a strong balance sheet, Catalyst purchased another asset that could start to pay off as early as next year. In July, it paid Santhera Pharmaceuticals roughly $231 million, plus royalties for the rights to Vamorolone, a potential first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drug candidate already has Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the Food and Drug Administration, which is due to make an approval decision on it by Oct. 26. If approved, the drug could compete in a relatively large market -- there are 11,000 to 13,000 people in the U.S. with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second quarter, the company's net income was $37.8 million, up 74.7% over the same period last year, while earnings were $0.33 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Those results led the company to raise its full-year revenue guidance to between $380 million and $390 million, compared to the $214.2 million it reported last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite those numbers, the stock trades at less than 13 times earnings (compared to the average price-to-earnings ratio of around 19 for drug manufacturers) and slightly more than 8 times forward earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realty Income's price is finally right\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problem before now for Realty Income was that the REIT had gotten a little too popular, so its stock was overpriced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is one of the few that pays dividends monthly, and that, along with the company's strong tradition of raising its payouts regularly, helps explain the stock's popularity among Robinhood's retail investors. The huge REIT owns or has interests in 13,118 properties, leased to 1,303 clients across 85 industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately, however, the one-two punch of high interest rates and rising Treasury yields has pummeled REITs. The first part means their costs of borrowing have gone up, in some cases, faster than they can raise rents to make up for the difference. The second part means conservative investors looking for dependable investments can seize 5% yields with little risk, giving them a better option in some cases than dividend-paying stocks. That trend has sent Realty Income's stock below $50 and to a 52-week low of $48.41.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the company's financials remain solid, and at its lower share price, its yield has climbed above 6%, making the stock more attractive than ever. That means Realty Income's shares have a good chance of having a rebound that beats the overall market. At its current price, the stock's price-to-funds-from-operations (FFO) ratio is about 13.6%, compared to the NAREIT average of 15.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first half of 2023, Realty Income reported revenue of $1.963 billion, up 21.3% year over year, and adjusted funds from operation (AFFO) of $1.322 billion, up 13.6%. The company also raised its monthly dividend from $0.255 per share to $0.2555 per share for its July distribution, bringing its streak of hikes without cuts to 103. Despite the dividend raise, because the company's AFFO also rose, the AFFO payout ratio remains a somewhat conservative 76.5%, leaving room for more increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "With so many properties, some of its tenants are likely to struggle, but the company's portfolio occupancy rate remains high, at 99%, with only 137 properties available for lease or sale. In the first quarter, its occupancy rate was 99%, and a year ago, the occupancy rate was 98.9%.\n",

October 28 will be the last night, not only for 2023 but permanently, according to a spokesperson. The decision to cease operations with Bronx Night Market stems from “concerns for the safety of its dedicated team and valued vendors, challenges in garnering substantial support from the community” in Fordham Plaza as well as difficulty securing funding, a press release states. Its loss will be felt locally: The night market has become a launching pad for local food businesses, including most recently for the new restaurant Patok by Rach, a lechon spot that hosted pop-ups at the market before opening a standalone space in Inwood.

      "\n",
      "Foreclosure filings – including default notices, scheduled auctions, and bank repossessions – jumped 28% in the third quarter from the prior quarter to 124,539, the real estate data group ATTOM said in a recent report. That represents a 34% surge from a year ago, attesting to growing financial distress among US homeowners.\n",
      "\n",
      "And foreclosure activity appears to have been increasing steadily through 2023. September alone saw an 11% jump in foreclosure filings to 37,679, up 18% from September of last year, researchers added.\n",

      "Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, began the foreclosure process on 68,961 properties in the US over the past quarter, up 3% from the third quarter of 2022.\n",

      "That rise is partly attributed by the end of mortgage forbearance and foreclosure moratorium programs brought about during the pandemic, which were rolled back during 2021 and 2022. That exposed a number of households that have been strained financially in the post-pandemic economy, with inflation still hovering well-above the Fed's 2% target.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Foreclosures are on the rise again this quarter, as indicated by our latest foreclosure numbers,\" ATTOM CEO Rob Barber said in a statement on Thursday. \"Even with the national economic upturn and job stability, it's evident that some homeowners are still grappling with the pandemic's financial aftermath or encountering new challenges.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Economists have warned that American consumers could grow even more strained over the following quarter, particularly as student loan payments resume. Making those payments could put more pressure on households' finances, especially considering that 34% of borrowers say that they not be able to make their student loan payments at all, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those stressors come amid an already-precarious time in the housing market, where sales have shuddered to a near-halt as high mortgage rates push buyers and sellers to the sidelines. High rates have also contributed to the dearth of available housing inventory, which has also boosted home prices.\n",

      "A majority of Market vendors are open to pedestrianizing Pike Place and only around 5 of 61 vendors interviewed fully opposed the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting most vehicle traffic off the thoroughfare that is Pike Place so that pedestrians can more easily take over the space is a perennial topic of conversation in Seattle. The conventional wisdom is that while everyday residents who visit Pike Place Market may be in favor of restricting the ability of people in cars to drive right through the market along Pike Place, vendors and business owners inside the working farmers market are much less on board with the idea, and that’s why the idea hasn’t gone anywhere. A newly released survey completed by two University of Washington students turns that assumption on its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tsz Him Lau and Kat Lykins, working as interns with Seattle Neighborhood Greenways, spent several days in early 2023, the slowest season for Pike Place Market traffic, conducting in-person interviews, often directly with the owners of Pike Place businesses, about the idea of restricting Pike Place itself to delivery vehicles, asking questions about loading needs and how they see the current street functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The businesses they stopped at were located on every area of the Market, from the high stalls along the high traffic main arcade, to the less well-traveled areas on the lower floors. In the end, they were able to talk to nearly 70 people who have a front row seat on the current operation of the Market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vendor opinions tended to be more aligned with the general public than conventional wisdom held. A 2021 poll of Seattle voters conducted by Change Research found that 81% of respondents supported pedestrianizing Pike Place with accommodations for loading and unloading. It turns out, most vendors seem to be of the same mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lau and Lykins’ goal wasn’t to create a statistically valid survey, but instead to more clearly understand vendors needs and ideas about traffic there, given the high frequency that vendor opposition is trotted out to push back on the idea of creating more people space at the Market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were merely there to listen to them and not chip in with our opinions about the matter,” Lykins said. “We just really want to know their concerns, because their concerns are what mattered most.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drivers heading directly down Pike Place, often aided by GPS, has been a head-scratching element of Seattle’s most visited tourist attraction for decades. (Stephen Fesler)\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the 61 individual vendors and businesses that they were able to interview, only a handful — around five — were fully against the idea of moving the Market in a more pedestrian-oriented direction. “In this group of vendors, we found that they think the street works well, and they didn’t see any conflicts between pedestrians and private vehicles, believing the cars add to the market’s character and are needed for business purposes and bulk loads,” the pair wrote in a summary of their research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over half of the responses collected were fully behind the idea of closing the main Pike Place corridor to through traffic, while still allowing vehicle deliveries. The rest expressed reservations with how the closure could be implemented but remained open to the idea of a change. “Provide flexibilities, limit cars but not all,” one response noted. “Market tenants should be the only ones driving through,” read another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We found that a lot of people tend to support the idea of pedestrianizing Pike Place Market, which is really surprising to us since we thought [they believed] that pedestrianization would bring fewer vehicles to the street, and that it will probably lower their income,” Lau said. “Yeah, we were surprised by the findings, we thought that they weren’t going to be in support just because of word of mouth… that’s kind of what we heard, that people didn’t like the idea of pedestrianization,” Lykins said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interviews revealed that most of the concerns vendors had were not around providing access to customers in cars, but on other issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Loading and unloading was mentioned the most by vendors as they overwhelmingly want to have a specific spot which will not be taken by private vehicles,” they wrote. “Some vendors mentioned that the current mix of pedestrians, delivery trucks, and private vehicles are a dangerous and chaotic situation. We heard several horror stories about market workers and customers being hit or nearly hit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, SDOT took a plan for a curbless street on Pike Street across from the Market even further by pedestrianizing half of the block, changing the dynamic of the entire street. Similar permanent moves inside the Market have received more push back. (Ryan Packer)\n",
      "\n",
      "The results provide daylight between Pike Place Market’s frontline workers and business owners and the institutions that operate the Market day-to-day, along with the numerous institutions involved in advocating on behalf of the Market. The Pike Place Public Development Authority (PDA) is ultimately the entity with the power to move forward on any changes around the street’s operation, but groups like the Pike Place Market Foundation, Friends of the Market, and the Pike Place Market Constituency will all need to be brought along as well. (Full disclosure: This reporter served on the board of Friends of the Market for several years and saw up close the knee-jerk reaction that the idea of pedestrianizing the Market receives inside those circles.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument against increased pedestrianization has often boiled down to, “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Peter Steinbrueck, the former city councilmember and port commissioner held in high esteem by the Market community thanks to his advocacy around preserving elements of the Market over the past few decades, wrote in an op-ed in 2022 that “traffic is actually part of the success of the Market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Market would be lessened without the traffic spine and interaction of transport and service-vehicle access which is essential to the health of the retail and accessible short-term parking,” Steinbrueck added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virtually no one is proposing to not allow deliveries or service vehicles to access Pike Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the idea of restricting vehicle access to Pike Place has percolated for years, the fact that the Market is largely self-regulated has always stopped the idea from gaining traction. (Stephen Fesler)\n",
      "\n",
      "Seattle artist and Market advocate Billy King, writing in the newsletter for the Friends of the Market early last year, offered an explanation of the reluctance of the Market’s institutions to try a long-term pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The idea (of a car-less Pike Place) was finally implemented a decade or more ago by the Market landlord for one month during high summer season,” King wrote. “The results were a disaster for merchants in the four floors of retail below street level, known collectively as Down Under…. And so quietly the results of the ‘car free’ experiment in the Pike Place Market were shelved. It turned out that cars on Pike Place served as people distributors, forcing pedestrians to take a variety of routes to wind their way through the Market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower levels of the Market have never been well advertised, with many longtime Seattle residents fully unaware of some of the interesting businesses down on those floors. The city’s new waterfront, which will turn the neglected back side of the Market into a second front door, could end up providing a revitalization for the Down Under all on its own, with the new Overlook Walk providing a direct route from the new public spaces at the water’s edge to the elevators and stairwells that lead to the Market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May, a Seattle Neighborhood Greenways bike tour examined the progress at Pier 62, where the aquarium and Overlook Walk are under construction. The Overlook Walk will funnel people walking, rolling, and biking toward Pike Place Market’s Down Under. (Doug Trumm)\n",
      "\n",
      "But there might also be additional things the Market could do, like better signage, to help that effort along. The radical change to come when the waterfront project is complete suggests that the Market as a whole could be at a turning point.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for looking to leadership from Seattle’s city hall, policymakers are clearly waiting for the Market to take the lead on any potential changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you travel internationally, or even through other parts of the United States, you find great examples of working markets…that are largely pedestrian focused environments,” Councilmember Andrew Lewis, whose district includes the Market, said at a forum in September. “I don’t see why it wouldn’t work effectively at Pike Place. That said, I have great respect for the institutions that make up the Pike Place Market, and I think that for this to happen, it requires the buy-in, it requires the organizing and it requires the deliberation of the historic organs of the Market that have been the policymaking bodies that have determined…how the Market has evolved over the years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If that evolution is going to be able to continue, it helps to be open and honest about what the biggest obstacles to change might be, and it’s clear that at least a sizable number of Market vendors are on board with trying something new.\n",

      "Even though the Indian equity market declined for the second straight session on Friday and has been on a consolidation path since the second half of September, it is less than 3 percent away from peaks hit earlier last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent decline in the Indian market is on the back of the results of IT majors which are struggling with weak numbers on revenue guidance for FY24 and lack of clarity on growth recovery. IT stocks dragged after Infosys and HCL Tech cut revenue outlook after the Q2 earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the global trend is also slightly negative as the US retail inflation for September at 3.7 percent came slightly higher than expected. The implication of this higher inflation trend is that the fight to bring the US inflation to the long-term target of 2 percent will take more time and, therefore, rates will remain higher for longer. This will restrain a rally in equity markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the domestic macros have turned distinctly positive with the CPI inflation in September falling steeply to 5.02 percent and the IIP for August rising impressively to 10.3 percent. This implies that the RBI MPC can pause for the rest of FY24 and go for a rate cut in the second quarter of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, it is also important to keep an eye out on the rising US bond yields and the Israel-Hamas conflict. Investors hope that the Israel-Hamas conflict will remain a localised crisis that will not impact crude prices. However, they remain cautious since the situation taking a turn for the worse cannot be ruled out.\n",

      "Furthermore, even though FIIs are sustained sellers in the market, buying by DIIs, HNIs and retail are counterbalancing the selling and supporting the market.\n",

      "The fact that Nifty is less than 3 percent away from the all-time high indicates the strength and resilience of the market.\n",

      "\n",
      "The benchmarks Nifty and Sensex declined around half a percent in intra-day deals on Friday, however, for the month of October so far, the benchmarks remain in the green, up 0.45 percent. This comes after a 2 percent gain in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall in 2023 YTD, the Nifty has advanced around 9 percent, giving positive returns in 7 of the 10 months so far. The index was in the red in the first 2 months of 2023 as well as in August. It rose the most in April, up 4 percent and fell the most in August, down 2.5 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since hitting its record high of 20,222.45 on September 15, 2023, Nifty has been in the green in 6 of the 18 sessions.\n",

      "Meanwhile, in the last 1 year, the benchmark has given double-digit returns, up 16 percent.\n",

      "\n",
      "Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities PMS\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors should remain cautious but should focus on the earnings growth trajectory. Companies with strong earnings growth will continue to deliver healthy returns. Thus, quality and growth investing should be the key focus areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The themes that the market should explore are consumption and asset repricing themes. FY24 will see a significant uptick in election spending. This development will boost consumption spending. Asset repricing is also an important theme as plants and machinery across the board are likely to see higher valuations. The market opportunities continue to be in small and mid-sized banks, NBFCs, autos and auto ancillary space, and pharmaceuticals.\n",
      "\n",
      "New investors should take time to build portfolios and invest in areas they understand well. During bull markets, everybody makes money, and during bear markets, only a few manage to escape unscathed. The markets will continue to see these cycles. Thus, investing in areas that they understand will help in better decision-making when the cycle turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemang Kapasi, Head of Equities, Sanctum Wealth\n",
      "\n",
      "There is still a significant impetus for infrastructure building in several verticals, especially railways, roads, power, defence, and civil utilities. For the first three months of this fiscal, central government capex surged by 60 percent YoY to ₹2.8 lakh crore. Sustained infrastructure investments shall help the capital goods, industrials, and infrastructure sectors to continue performing in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auto and auto ancillary sectors shall also continue to see selective traction as a few sub-segments in the industry are performing extremely well and with the upcoming festive season, the momentum is expected to continue. BFSI will also be a good space for stock picking. The credit growth is sustaining at mid-double digits, which is an enabling environment for niche small and midcap lenders to grow well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also positive on healthcare as a theme, which is being supported by improving healthcare infrastructure, improved demand backed by government schemes, higher insurance penetration and improving supply in tier 2 cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, our model portfolio is fairly diversified with the highest weight in financials, followed by industrial and manufacturing, consumer discretionary, and IT. We were very positive on our top two themes in the previous year, and we continue to be positive now as well. However, as the low-hanging fruits are gone with the rally, we are trimming some positions to rebalance the portfolio and get into newer themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspective and Research, SAMCO Securities\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors can protect their portfolios by diversifying in non-correlated assets. So if you have all your investments into equities whether large, mid, or small-cap, it won’t matter much. If there is a crash in the markets, it will affect all three. But if you have allocations towards gold, silver, currency, and fixed-income securities, then the overall impact on your portfolio will be minimised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crude oil has been racing higher and trading above the $90/ barrel mark. One should stay away from industries like aviation, tyres, and paints which have crude oil and its derivatives as an important raw material. One should also stay away from oil marketing companies as they won’t have much pricing power if crude spikes higher from here given that we are heading for elections soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ideal portfolio could have 60-70 percent equity allocation while the remaining portion can be spread out evenly between gold and fixed-income securities. The allocation should shift more towards gold and fixed income as we move closer to the general elections next year. Elections are bound to create some volatility in the markets which will be difficult to digest for many players. Hence, one must lower his/her exposure and wait on the sidelines for the dust to settle.\n",

      "No matter if we're talking about Nifty, Bank Nifty, or any other index, the fundamental principle for achieving long-term investment success remains the same: build a diversified portfolio that matches your financial objectives and comfort with risk. Taking a long-term view, ideally over a span of 3 to 5 years, is absolutely essential. We are not far away from the end of 2023, and the market has recently reached an all-time high. However, looking ahead, it appears that we may experience a time-bound correction, consequently, it would be prudent not to expect substantial returns by the year's end.\n",

      "Here’s some fresh news for all of us managing our own retirement accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bear of Beacon Hill has spoken — and on one thing specifically, history says he is probably right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re talking about legendary Boston fund manager Jeremy Grantham, the founder of white-shoe fund company GMO and a longtime predictor of doom. As reported by MarketWatch’s Barbara Kollmeyer, Grantham has given an interview to a Bloomberg podcast in which he made three big investment calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first two are that the stock market could fall 50% from here and that investors should steer clear of U.S. stocks altogether because they are overvalued. Maybe he’s right, maybe he isn’t. Both are calls he’s made several times in the past. Subsequent events have not always conformed to the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s Grantham’s third call that is most interesting, especially to anyone trying to save enough to retire on someday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grantham urged investors to focus on so-called high-quality stocks, which he called “a free lunch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When it comes to quality, they have less risk of every kind, they have less debt, they go bankrupt less, they have less volatility, they have a lower beta. … That is a free lunch,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is he right? History says: Almost certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-quality stocks, typically meaning those of companies with things like high returns on equity, stable earnings and low levels of debt, have persistently been a better investment than the overall stock market for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s been true not only here in the U.S., but also in developed overseas markets like Europe and Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more clearly, high-quality stocks have produced their greatest successes during market downturns, crashes, bear markets and slumps. That’s when they’ve held up best, while the weakest stocks have tanked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not every financial expert agrees with this, incidentally. Many question whether company quality is really any kind of reliable indicator of stock-market outperformance. There has been a trend in academia to suggest that many of these so-called investment factors are bogus, the product of data mining, p-hacking (don’t ask), publication bias and other sins.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the number crunchers at hedge-fund company AQR have argued that quality is not only a strong source of investment returns, it’s a major source of Warren Buffett’s success — and $120 billion fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Buffett himself has said, he’d rather buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof of a free lunch, surely — like the proof of a pumpkin pie, an allegedly $5.5 billion fake-meat sandwich or pretty much anything else — is in the eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "MSCI, the organization that tracks stock-market data around the world, has been monitoring indexes of “quality” stocks on a price basis since the mid-1970s, and on a total return basis — meaning including dividends — since the mid-1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the average 12-month period since 1975, looking only at the price indexes, quality stocks have beaten the overall stock market by 1.7 percentage points in the U.S., 1.3 percentage points in Europe and 0.4 points in Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Factoring in dividends as well, from 1994, quality stocks have beaten the overall stock market by 1.5 percentage points a year in the U.S., by 1.9 points a year in Japan and by 2 points a year in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, these have really added up. If you’d invested $100,000 in the broad U.S. stock market in November 1994 (using the MSCI U.S.A. standard index of large and midsize companies as a proxy), reinvesting all dividends, today you’d have $1.6 million before tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you’d invested in high-quality U.S. stocks alone, you’d have $2.7 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d invested that money in European stocks, you’d have about $700,000 today. But if you’d picked high-quality European stocks, you’d have twice as much: $1.4 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Japan, which has struggled with lost decades of dismal returns, still sees a similar divergence. According to MSCI data, $100,000 invested in Japan back in late 1994 would be worth just $170,000 today. But the same figure in high-quality Japanese stocks would be worth $250,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "In MSCI’s data, the outperformance of quality has been persistent, but not consistent. It has lasted over long periods of time. But it has not shown up every month, or every year. There have been several years at a time when quality stocks have done worse than the overall market. Finance is not a natural science like physics, no matter what the professors like to claim. This water does not always boil at 100 degrees Celsius at one atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, U.S. quality stocks handily beat the rest of the market during the bear market of 2000-03 and during the global financial crisis of 2007-09. European quality stocks outperformed, at certain points by 10 full points a year, during the European debt crisis of 2010-13. Japan’s stock market entered a brutal, long-running bear market at the start of the 1990s. But at the end of the decade, measured in U.S. dollars, Japanese quality stocks were still nearly 50% higher than they had been at the end of 1989.\n",
      "\n",
      "But quality underperformed the overall stock market during other periods. It did badly from 2004 to 2007, when the stocks you wanted to own tended to be in doomed kamikaze companies like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Countrywide Financial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are they now? Quality stocks have been beating the broader market index in the U.S. for about a year, but they have been trailing the indexes in Europe and Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Grantham is correct, we should be investing — especially if we fear a downturn ahead — in funds such as the iShares MSCI U.S.A. Quality Factor exchange-traded fund QUAL and the MSCI International Quality Factor ETF IQLT. Both have low fees, at 0.15% and 0.3% respectively. And if history is any guide, they will fall less far in a slump and will make us more money in the long term.\n",

      "WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - The price of housing keeps on an upward trend, a situation seen in Kansas and across the U.S. Data from REALTORS of South Central Kansas shows while home sales slowed some last month, the average sale price is up 7.5% over the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions continue to be favorable to sellers as demand from buyers remains strong. After three years of an especially active housing market, REALTORS of South Central Kansas see inventory increasing and prices holding strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Braden McCurdy with McCurdy Real Estate and Auction and president of REALTORS of South Central Kansas said even with higher interest rates, buyers are not shying away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rates are still really good in the climate. It’s still a great time to buy. There’s inventory finally coming on the market,” said McCurdy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He added, “We are seeing inventory coming back up, finally. We had gotten as tight as 0.6 months supply of inventory and then today, we’re sitting at 1.9 months supply of inventory, again with a balanced market being in the five to six (month) range.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are fewer home sales happening, home prices continue increasing. McCurdy said it’s forecasted to be about a 4.2% appreciation rate this year, a slower rate than what’s recently been seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Values continue to hold and continue to slowly appreciate. A little bit more pre-COVID application rates,” McCurdy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "All those factors that made a hot market the last few years also come into play in other ways. It’s part of the factor that impacts appraised values.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2023, most Sedgwick County homeowners saw a 10% increase in their home’s appraised value.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had high inflation. That pushed prices,” said Sedgwick County Appraiser Mark Clark. “Naturally, you have a tight supply. When you have all of that happening, appraised values will increase, and they did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He added, “Of course, age, location, square footage, remodeling and the sales prices of similar properties are the main drivers there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sedgwick County Appraiser's Office (Sedgwick County Appraiser's Office)\n",
      "\n",
      "Clark discussed this topic with county commissioners last week. He said part of the reason residential properties have such a significant impact is 75 percent of parcels in Sedgwick County are residential, for a total of 182,000 parcels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you look at commercial, that represents roughly six percent of the parcels. That is a weaker market. The residential market is so much stronger than the commercial that you have this ramping up. That is the reason why that chart is, it’s upsetting to some property owners, especially the residential. Well, look at that; it’s like it’s taken wings. It’s flying and look at these people over here, the commercial they’re going down,” said Clark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kansas lawmakers are considering a constitutional amendment to cap valuation increases at 4% in a year with exceptions including for new construction and remodeling. Clark said while that idea may sound beneficial, that idea comes with drawbacks. He said that might discourage people from making property improvements, and it doesn’t take into consideration if there’s a downturn in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you have a number of years where property values are increasing, of course, you still have a cap, but say the economy turns sour, then there’s nothing I have seen in that legislation that’s sort of like a circuit breaker that says the economy has now turned sour, that four percent cap still continues. We’re still going to be putting that 4% on, and maybe the market has dropped 20%. People are going to be really angry,” Clark said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said another concern is FEMA reimbursement after a disaster. That is based on the official appraised value. Clark said a cap would lead to an artificial value, so it could mean people are reimbursed less than the property is worth.\n",

      "\n",
      "Weeks after opening, the property housing the buzzy new Guinness Open Gate Brewery in West Loop — already a booming tourist attraction — is set to change hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Latsko, a Chicago real estate developer, has listed the building at 901 W. Kinzie St. for sale and hired the commercial brokerage firm JLL to look for a buyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Latsko Interests manages properties in six states, but most of its commercial holdings are in Chicago’s Gold Coast neighborhood. A mix of luxury and nationwide companies operate from Latsko buildings, including Lanvin, Lululemon, Citi Bank and Intermix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six brokers from JLL have been tasked with finding a buyer for the 15,000-square-foot space, CoStar News reported. The brewery will remain operational even if the building changes hands, Irish Central reported Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“While the landlord is selling the property, the business is not for sale,” a Guinness Open Brewery Chicago spokesperson said. “Guinness is fully committed to the space, the West Loop community and is thrilled to have had such a strong opening two weeks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicago’s hotly anticipated Guinness brewery was announced in 2021, and opened Sept. 28 to thirsty crowds. Twelve to 16 beers, mixing Irish specialties and local drafts, are on tap every day, alongside a full-service restaurant and bakery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guinness has also committed to donating 10,000 loaves of bread a year to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, the Tribune previously reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Latsko applied in April to have the area around the brewery rezoned from an industrial commercial district to a downtown mixed-use district, according to city documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guinness has been found on taps around the world for more than 260 years, starting with the St. James Gate Brewery in Dublin. Arthur Guinness, the company’s first master brewer, famously took out a 9,000-year lease on the brewery in 1759 and began exporting the now-iconic black Guinness porter beer in 1796. Guinness is now produced at more than 50 breweries worldwide, but only Open Gate Breweries welcome the public for tours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open Gate Breweries also opened in Dublin in 2015 and Baltimore in 2018. As both of these locations are owned by Guinness, Latsko and JLL are pitching the Chicago brewery as a unique chance to raise a glass to private ownership, Latsko said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s time to pass the torch, or in this case, the tap, to new stewardship,” Latsko said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keely Polczynski, managing director of capital markets for JLL and one of the brokers representing Latsko in the sale, declined to comment Thursday, saying that the brewery was not yet officially on the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "JLL has not started contacting potential buyers and has not made projections for how much the brewery might sell for, Polczynski said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A source close to the deal told CoStar News earlier this week that brokers expect to fetch upward of $20 million for the space, previously home to the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot. The brewery will remain operational as the property changes hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "A source close to the sale said that the presence of the Guinness brewery in the space is backed by a 10-year lease, which will remain even if the building is sold.\n",

      "The YèShì Chinatown Night Market will be returning Oct. 12. Pictured is the Lion Dance performance by Cheung Hung Gar Kung Fu School during the Mid-Autumn Festival in Chinatown in Philadelphia, Pa., Saturday, Sept., 17, 2022. Read more\n",
      "\n",
      "After being paused for four years because of the pandemic, the YèShì Chinatown Night Market will be returning Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market, founded by the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC) in 2011, used to be held every year, attracting more than 20,000 people, on average. But once the pandemic hit, the market shut down — until community members decided to bring it back this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its founding, the YèShì Chinatown Night Market has been an ode to Chinese culture and tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The idea of having a night market is something that originates from China,” said Haoyi Shang, commercial corridor manager for PCDC and one of the organizers of the night market. Shang said that Rachel Mak, deputy director of PCDC, felt inspired to organize the market after her trips to China.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a place where everyone around the city comes — no matter what ethnicity, race you are — to just enjoy great food and great entertainment.” Anna Quan\n",
      "\n",
      "“[Mak] saw a very lively night market scene in Hong Kong and other places in China, and she said we should have something similar in Chinatown,” Shang said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Anna Quan, another organizer of the event, the YèShì Night Market has been a staple throughout her upbringing in Chinatown — and a way for her to connect with her heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“It really does bring a lot of the Asian culture … and it’s a place where everyone around the city comes — no matter what ethnicity, race you are — to just enjoy great food and great entertainment,” Quan said. “I think it also empowers the Chinatown community as well, to be able to showcase different businesses and food trucks within the city.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shang added that they hope the night market will attract non-Chinatown residents to view the neighborhood as a destination and a safe area to visit at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located on 10th and Race Streets in Chinatown, the night market will feature a diversity of food vendors, arts and crafts vendors, performances, and activities. Food will include Korea Taqueria, Byzantium Empire, Sang Lee Noodle House, and Husky Jaws Corn Roasting Co.\n",
      "\n",
      "» READ MORE: Community members rallied to keep Kingsessing Rec’s basketball courts open. Parks and Rec listened\n",
      "\n",
      "The Philadelphia Suns, Chinatown’s basketball team, will be performing their traditional Lion Dance at the night market. But this year will also appeal to younger generations with more modern performances, including spoken word poetry and K-Pop cover bands, and dance groups, such as Temple University’s EFIX.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very diverse this year,” Shang said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market will also feature a table to discuss the proposed Sixers’ arena and the impact community members believe it will have on neighboring Chinatown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers describe the $1.55 billion arena — which would rise on the footprint from 10th to 11th and Market to Filbert Streets, its northern end abutting Chinatown at Cuthbert Street — as a tax-generating win for the city, one that would create jobs and drive spending and foot traffic east of Market Street. But Chinatown community members and supporters say the arena would cause gentrification and displacement in the historic neighborhood, one of the last remaining communities of color in Center City.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t our main focus at the beginning… but at this point, we realized that’s an ongoing issue that’s going to impact our community deeply,” Shang said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The YèShì Chinatown Night Market will be held Thursday, Oct. 12 from 6 to 10 p.m., from Arch and 10th Streets up north to Race Street between 11th and 9th Streets.\n",

      "We now have seven companies -- excluding state-run organizations -- that have achieved market capitalizations of $1 trillion after Nvidia shares rocketed higher earlier this summer. Tesla and Meta Platforms now have market capitalizations of less then $1 trillion, but have passed that milestone previously, while Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet have been consistently above $1 trillion for years now. These dynamic technology stocks have crushed the market in recent years, providing life-changing returns for many of their long-term investors.\n",

      "Visa operates the leading credit card and digital payments network around the world, processing $14.1 trillion in transaction volume in its fiscal 2022. It currently has more than 4 billion credit and debit cards in circulation. Because it is only a payments network, not a credit card issuer, Visa earns tiny fees on every payment transaction made through its network, but it takes minimal lending risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "With around a 40% market share of global credit card transactions, Visa has a competitive advantage that's nearly insurmountable, which should keep it insulated from any upstart networks. According to the company, more than 100 million merchant locations accept Visa cards. Merchants are unlikely to add a raft of new payment options for their customers unless they love wasting time and confusing shoppers. They generally choose to accept Visa because of its ubiquity. And consumers and banks favor it because they know virtually every merchant in the world will accept a Visa card.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cashless forms of payment have multiple tailwinds that Visa should be able to ride for the foreseeable future. Most important is the steady transition of consumer activity away from physical cash. More and more people around the globe are using credit cards and mobile phone apps to pay for things, which means more payments flowing through the Visa network. The company also benefits from inflation as it earns a percentage on every dollar processed through the Visa network. If inflation is 3% a year and Visa maintains its market share, that will add about 3% to its annual revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The math behind a $1 trillion valuation\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of periods of market frothiness, high-quality businesses of Visa's caliber typically trade at price-to-earnings ratios in the 25 to 30 range. Today, Visa trades at the top of that range. It has a market cap of $493 billion, so it would need to roughly double to breach the $1 trillion threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's assume Visa will trade at about the same earnings ratio in the coming years as it does today. That means it would need to double its net income to join the trillion-dollar market cap club. I think it can do so in five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "How? First, I predict that it will be able to increase revenue at about 10% annually as it rides the transition to digital payments and benefits from global inflation. Second, with close to 100% incremental margins on new revenue, Visa has incredible operating leverage. That should lead to margin expansion as it grows. Today, its operating margin is an impressive 67%, but there is still room for it to go higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a combination of 10% annualized revenue growth and margin expansion, Visa could grow its bottom line by 15% per annum. At that pace, it would double its earnings in five years. Considering that most companies outside of the big tech realm are far away from a trillion-dollar market cap, I think this gives Visa a good chance at being the next company to hit that milestone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who could beat Visa?\n",
      "\n",
      "Visa is currently the 11th-largest company in the world by market cap. Two stocks ahead of it that haven't crossed the $1 trillion mark yet are the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Warren Buffett's diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't be too afraid of Berkshire Hathaway getting there first, because it focuses on slower growing, steady value investments. Eli Lilly could be a wild card as sales of its new weight-loss drugs are growing like gangbusters and are projected to hit $100 billion annually by 2035. However, it does trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 80, which gives it much more downside risk than Visa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another strong candidate is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which has a market cap slightly lower than Visa's. The leading third-party computer chip foundry is growing quickly and has huge industry tailwinds at its back. As long as geopolitical threats from China don't kill the business, there's a possibility it will beat Visa to the $ trillion milestone. But the geopolitical risks are real for Taiwan Semi, which leads me to think Visa has a better chance of crossing the threshold first.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if Visa is the next company to join the trillion-dollar market cap club. All that matters to shareholders is whether Visa is increasing its earnings per share and building value. Over the long term, those things will lead to stock price appreciation and wealth accumulation for its investors.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the middle of West Street, a one-block stretch between the Boston Common and Downtown Crossing’s main drag, sit two conjoined, nondescript buildings that encapsulate the current struggles of the downtown office market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pair of office buildings at 33-41 West St. — one five stories with a dingy white facade, the other, eight floors of red brick — are about half full, like the street itself, with empty lots and buildings surrounding a dormitory for Suffolk University, nonprofit and union offices. Shoppers meander through the $1, $3, and $5 outdoor racks at Brattle Book Shop; a few lots down, a developer has proposed turning a surface parking lot into a hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement:\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven years ago, this pair sold for $16 million; late last month, they fetched just a quarter of that at $4.1 million — a warning of the possible distress facing much of the city’s older, less full office stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no secret right now: the office market is challenging,” said Mai Luo, a local real estate executive who bought the West Street buildings. “However, I’m optimistic for the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Luo, president of boutique real estate investment firm Kendall Capital in Boston, said in an interview he’s considering all options, from keeping the property as is, to examining whether a conversion to housing through the city’s office-to-residential pilot program would work. (The pilot opens for a short period this fall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The property is 52 percent leased, Luo said. The $4.1 million deal was financed with funding from private local investors and brokered by Boston Realty Advisors.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bay Management Corp., a real estate firm with offices in Dedham and New York, bought the property in 2016, the $16 million purchase was more than double its previous sale price. Bay Management Corp. did not return messages seeking comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a 74 percent decline in value is a tough figure to grapple with, experts say it’s not necessarily reflective of the office market as a whole. At only half full, the property likely isn’t generating much rent, said Aaron Jodka, director of research for US capital markets with brokerage Colliers International, and such “nonperforming” properties are valued differently than a fully leased building with cash coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s important to understand the underlying performance of an asset when comparing a recent sale to a prior sale,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the more befuddling elements of Boston’s COVID recovery is the dual tracks of much of the city’s commercial real estate market: Some buildings are benefitting from a “flight to quality,” with companies deciding to move to newly constructed or renovated space, while others — especially older properties that haven’t seen much investment — are struggling with record availability and sublease space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few office buildings have sold in Greater Boston since the once-hot commercial real estate market entered a deep freeze during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and experts are watching the few that do closely. Two transactions over the summer caught the industry’s eye: the $45 million sale of One Liberty Square in the Financial District, at a 17 percent loss compared with its prior sale in 2013, and the $41 million sale of 70 Federal St., for an 8 percent gain since 2016. The 70 Federal deal, which closed in August, was the first office sale in downtown Boston in 18 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither sale presented as stark a picture as a nearly three-quarters discount for a property in the heart of downtown, half a block from the Park Street MBTA station. Jodka views the three deals on a spectrum, with the half-full West Street on the far end of a swinging pendulum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is an indicator of a subset of buildings, but that’s not the norm in Boston,” Jodka said. “This is not to say that you should expect values to be off 75 percent … for the broader market. That’s asset-specific.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One inescapable factor weighing on the market is an ongoing run of high interest rates. Most sales involve some form of debt or loan, and higher interest rates mean far higher debt payments for a buyer, said Phil Mobley, the national director of office analytics for real estate research firm CoStar in Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sign in a window at 41 West St. tells the story. DAVID L. RYAN/GLOBE STAFF\n",

      "Then there’s softer demand in a world where hybrid work is far more common than it was just a few years ago. Gone are the days when growing companies would lease extra space when they could in anticipation of future growth. Now, tenants are assessing how they actually use the space — and how much space they actually need.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is much more attention being paid to both the quantity and quality of office space,” Mobley said. “When you realize you don’t need as much, you can take that same amount of (investment) and put it toward nicer space.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Among big cities in the United States, Boston’s central business district office market suffered the “greatest deterioration” in the third quarter compared with earlier in the year, according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service that measures stress in the commercial real estate market. That quarterly decrease was largely driven by a downturn in demand, along with increasing vacancy rates, the report said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement:\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, Boston’s office vacancy rate ranks among the lowest of major US markets, said Darrell Wheeler, heads of CMBS research at Moody’s Investors Service. The city’s strong employment base and diverse economy give Boston more resiliency than other large markets, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re still going to figure out how hybrid works over the next three or four years, I expect. It’s a real experiment with most companies,” Wheeler said. “And so, where will you be, and how carefully do tax assessments actually follow the value of these assets? It’s hard to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the prospect of a commercial tax base that’s deteriorating in value is worrisome when considering that about 72 percent of the city’s operating revenue comes from property taxes — much of it commercial. At a City Council hearing last week, Councilor Michael Flaherty expressed concern about the impact of increasing vacancy rates — and the decline in real estate values that would likely follow — on city revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s how we pay for our schools. That’s how we pay for our parks, and our playgrounds, and our police department, and our fire department, and public works, snow plowing, tree pruning, snow removal, trash collection, all of it,” Flaherty said. “That’s how Boston ticks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s a warning, he said. If property taxes start to fall… “that’s a holy-bleep moment for Boston.”\n",

One of the key factors projected to affect market expansion is the rising number of multiplex lateral flow tests being developed by academic and research institutions. The test is a six-plex assay with six test spots printed on it. It is paired with a sensor known as the MACAW (Modular Automated Colorimetric Analysis Widget) for analysing and interpreting test results. It resolves the issues with capillary flow dynamics and the design restrictions in creating assays with many horizontal test lines.

      "The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how accelerating globalisation might negatively affect the transfer of microorganisms across international borders. As with the COVID-19 pandemic, isolated infection threats can become a global catastrophe if not handled and quickly disclosed. With the threat of climate change, the chance of locally transmitted illnesses reappearing has increased. The unnecessary and avoidable use of antibiotics and other treatments leads to new strains of viruses, bacteria, and other diseases becoming increasingly resistant to the current vaccinations and medications. Additionally, individuals are becoming more susceptible to animal viruses because they can now infect humans due to increased meat consumption and exotic meat. Increased risk from climate change, rapid growth, globalisation, pathogenic variables, and other human factors have increased the prevalence of infectious diseases. The rise in infectious diseases will result in an expansion of the lateral flow tests market globally.\n",

      "After most of the year saw the stock market on the rise, the markets are going through a volatile period. J.P. Morgan’s U.S. Head of Investment Strategy Jacob Manoukian claims each such period has its own unique character and this one has been defined by U.S. Treasury yields. Last week, interest rates on 10-year U.S. government debt climbed to 4.88%, amounting to a 16-year high, before pulling back to 4.65%.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treasury yields are like the foundation that the rest of financial markets are built on,” says Manoukian. “When the foundation is shaking, it is hard for other segments to find their footing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The result has been a sell-off period, but where some see only pain in the pullback, Manoukian makes the case there’s “good value in the market now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Earnings expectations are still climbing, while the drawdown has brought valuations back in line with the 10-year average level. From here, we think earnings season, positive seasonal trends and stabilizing bond yields will help equities start to rally again. Looking out, we think the chances are better than not that the S&P 500 makes a new all-time high by the middle of next year due to decent earnings growth and valuation expansion as inflation fades further,” Manoukian opined.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with that positive outlook in tow, the question is, which equities should investors be loading up on at present? The analysts at JPMorgan have been busy seeking them out and have homed in on two stocks they see as primed to take off, including one with 80% upside. Let’s take a closer look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apellis Pharmaceuticals (APLS)\n",
      "\n",
      "The first stock on our JPMorgan-backed list is Apellis Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm operating at both the commercial and clinical stages. The company is developing new therapeutic agents, ‘first new class of complement medicine in 15 years,’ that act through the C3 pathway, the complement system of the larger immune system. The complement cascade, which starts with the C3 protein, clears damaged cells and pathogens out the body, and when it becomes overactive it causes disease conditions through the destruction of healthy cells and tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story continues\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s focus is on diseases of the retina and nervous system that have high unmet medical needs – that is, there are few or no effective treatment options available. Apellis is targeting the C3 pathway as a therapeutic starting point, and has a wide-ranging project pipeline. The company’s research is heavy on the pre-clinical development stages, but also has two drugs approved and on the market for commercialization, as well as several late-stage clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apellis’ approved drugs are two different formulations of pegcetacoplan. Empaveli, the company’s first drug on the market, is a treatment for adults suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and was approved in May of 2021. In 2022, the first full year that the drug was available for patients, Apellis realized $65.1 million in net product revenues from its US sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second commercial-stage drug is syfovre, another pegcetacoplan injection formulation. This one is used to treat geographic atrophy (GA), a severe retinal condition that leads to blindness. Syfovre was approved in February of this year, and showed early success in the marketplace. There were serious concerns during the summer, however, over the occurrence of eye inflammation as a side effect. The stock plunged as far as 71% when the concerns were raised, but has since begun a modest rebound. Analysts have noted that similar drugs also showed vasculitis as a side effect, and that syfovre has shown a less severe incidence that other approved drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent piece of good news, for Apellis and syfovre, early Q3 sales data for syfovre were better than expected, anticipated to reach $74 million, easily exceeding the $51 million consensus estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong sales data were only one part of JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama’s upgrade on APLS shares, from Neutral to Overweight (i.e., Buy). Rama is upbeat on the overall potential of pegcetacoplan, and writes, “We believe Apellis’ lead asset, pegcetacoplan, represents a differentiated asset in the complement space, with opportunities in a broad range of ophthalmology, hematology, neurology, and nephrology indications. With the recent approvals of Syfovre in GA and Empaveli in PNH, the company has made strong progress on the overall pipeline. Indeed, we view Syfovre as a ~$3B peak potential drug, even with conservative assumptions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, Rama does not ignore the concerns regarding syfovre, but believes that the drug will prove successful in the long run: “Of note, the company does need to work through physician perception of Syfovre, given recent disclosures of cases of retinal vasculitis and this could take time (there is risk of disclosure of additional headline with more cases). That said, physicians continue to use the product driven growth and we anticipate a fundamental and sentiment shift driving upside in APLS shares.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These comments back up Rama’s $81 price target on APLS, which implies a robust one-year upside potential of ~82% for the stock. (To watch Rama’s track record, click here)\n",
      "\n",
      "The general Wall Street sentiment here is also bullish, as shown by the 14 recent analyst reviews – which include 12 Buys and 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $44.40, and its $68.17 average price target suggests it will gain 53% in the next 12 months. (See APLS stock forecast)\n",
      "\n",
      "Live Oak Bancshares (LOB)\n",
      "\n",
      "The second stock we’ll look at is Live Oak Bancshares, a holding company and owner of the Live Oak Bank. Live Oak is a North Carolina-based bank with a focus on the small-business loan market, particularly loans backed up by the US government through the Small Business Administration. In fact, per data from fiscal year 2022, Live Oak was the nation’s largest SBA loan administrator, counting by dollar volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the operational end, Live Oak is a cloud-based digital bank offering services in all 50 states. The bank’s customer base is primarily composed of small businesses, but the company also offers personal banking services to individual customers. Banking services include high-yield savings accounts and CDs, as well as online and mobile access – all without online or monthly banking fees. Accounts with Live Oak are insured through the FDIC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at performance, Live Oak brought in $108.46 million in revenues in 2Q23, the last reported quarter, surpassing the forecast by $1.4 million. At the company’s bottom line, Live Oak reported an EPS of 39 cents per diluted share, coming in 7 cents ahead of the estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead to the 3Q23 results, consensus is calling for revenues of $116.3 million and an EPS of 48 cents per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares in Live Oak hit a peak in August of this year, and have since fallen by more than 24%. However, JPMorgan Steven Alexopoulos believes the pullback could be the right time for investors to hop onboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The recent sell-off provides us with the entry point that we were waiting for. While LOB shares have underperformed over the past month in response to a rising 10-year yield, not only do we see a rising 10-year yield as providing a tailwind to the bank sector and LOB, but what’s more is that for LOB specifically, we see several near-term catalysts lined up to drive the stock toward our $40 price target,” Alexopoulos opined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting into some of Live Oak’s particular strengths, Alexopoulos wrote, “With Live Oak marrying (1) an industry vertical approach, (2) its tech savviness, and (3) differentiated service culture, we see Live Oak being positioned to lead the peer group in the metrics that have been associated with outperformance. Coupling this with the valuation of the stock having come in materially, we upgrade LOB shares to Overweight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexopoulos’ Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating comes along with a $40 price target that suggests the stock will appreciate by 37% in the year ahead. (To watch Alexopoulos’ track record, click here)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, LOB shares hold a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split among the Street’s analysts – 2 to Buy and 2 to Hold. The stock is trading for $29.13 and its $36.25 average price target implies an upside potential of 24% on the one-year time frame. (See LOB stock forecast)\n",

      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Promoting fair competition is a key pillar of Bidenomics, along with investing in America and empowering workers. Competition is the backbone of a market economy; it supports lower prices, higher quality goods and services, greater variety, and more innovation. Accordingly, President Biden has pushed for a whole-of-government approach to identify and address barriers to healthy competition wherever they appear, starting with an Executive Order in the early months of the Administration, which created the White House Competition Council and identified 72 actions agencies could take to increase competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Biden-Harris Administration implements its Investing in America agenda, which includes the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, there is a pivotal role for attention to competition. Just as regulations shape competition in existing markets, regulation and government investment can shape new and developing markets as well. By considering the promotion of competition in our investments, we can shape industries to be pro-competitive from the beginning so that there is no need to “unscramble the eggs”—to unwind highly concentrated industries after the fact. Similarly, the economic literature shows how industrial policies that foster competition and invest in strategic industries—while also “weeding out” projects that fail—can support economic growth. A robust competition policy complements our historic investments in America to develop mature, innovative industries that are competitive on a global scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released new guidance yesterday to help agencies developing Federal regulations better assess their potential effects on competition. In light of OMB’s new guidance, this blog describes the central role for competition in industrial strategy and how regulation can help shape fair and resilient markets for critical goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Competition and Industrial Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "The pillars of Bidenomics work together: for example, investments in America are designed to be pro-competitive, and pro-competitive policies are designed to support investment. Through his Investing in America agenda, the President is investing in new and rapidly growing industries, including the domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies and semiconductors, and working to ensure those markets are competitive and fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promoting healthy competition in these industries is best accomplished by proactively shaping markets to be fair from the outset. Anticompetitive markets dominated by a few (or one single firm) can stifle innovation and prevent good ideas and products from reaching the market. On the other hand, the use of pro-competitive policies to shape markets—for instance, enabling market entry by innovative new enterprises or facilitating competition between firms to constantly improve—helps to maximize the benefits from the President’s investments in foundation infrastructure and strategic industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making sure that larger competitors do not wall off key infrastructure is vital for promoting competition, and for allowing smaller entrants to eventually scale. The Investing in America agenda supports infrastructure investment, which is essential for maintaining competition in the economy. For example, investments in airports, bridges, and municipal bus fleets, such as those included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, are important for enabling competitive industries here at home. These projects ensure that goods and services can be transported efficiently, which lowers costs and encourages new suppliers to enter the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Administration is empowering the market to identify the most efficient clean energy technology for every application, rather than investing in one or two technologies or picking specific “national champion” firms. Many of the Administration’s investments in the Investing in America agenda are sector-based, meaning they invest in specific needs of the economy rather than individual companies or technologies. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act’s Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit allow electricity production from a multitude of different clean energy sources. Starting in January 2025, any energy project that produces zero greenhouse gas emissions is eligible for the credit, whether using wind, solar, hydroelectric, or some other energy source. Tax credits like these are powerful tools in part because they do not pick winners within an industry. Unlike industrial targeting and other distortive economic policies and practices, such as those from the Chinese government, they allow consumers to make the ultimate choices while encouraging manufacturers to compete against one another. More competitive U.S. manufacturers also means that consumers around the world have more options to choose from.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other cases, the goal of the Administration’s investments is to solve coordination problems. Case in point: in order to build the capacity to deliver the clean energy the United States needs, the Investing in America agenda seeks to create new regional clean energy hubs. Companies in the same industry or supply chain often cluster in local areas and cities. For example, many auto parts manufacturers are located near final auto assembly plants. These arrangements not only lower transportation costs, but also actively encourage entry by new firms, who have an easier time accessing customers and input suppliers. For new industries, however, it may be difficult for the private sector to arrange such clusters on its own due to a classic “chicken-and-egg” problem: the cluster is necessary for a variety of firms to succeed, but each party needs the others to establish themselves first.

      "Regulations can enhance competition. Earlier this year, the Federal Highway Administration outlined standards for electric vehicle chargers funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including requirements that the chargers have consistent plug types and power levels. Additionally, digital applications that support these charging stations must list the location, price, availability, and accessibility of chargers on a map, with a single app and account that must work for all chargers. These standards support fair competition in the electric vehicle market by enabling consumers to make choices based on the quality and price of the vehicle, not based on access to proprietary charging networks.\n",

      "OMB’s new guidance provides regulators with resources for considering competition effects when designing and evaluating new regulations. Federal agencies have long been required to assess the benefits and costs of certain proposed regulations to ensure that they serve the public interest. The new guidance on competition, which elaborates on existing guidance,[1] encourages regulators to consider important questions such as how competitive the regulated market already is, whether new regulation would affect the number of firms in the market, and how the regulation could affect competition in the labor market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the new guidance is not to overemphasize potential effects on competition, but rather to promote a baseline understanding regarding how and when these effects can emerge. Agencies can then apply their own extensive expertise to assess the relevance and importance of these potential competitive effects to a given proposed rule.\n",

In tandem with historic private-sector investments in America, agency rulemaking will play a critical role in shaping new markets. This new guidance provides Federal agencies with a toolkit for evaluating how proposed regulations may impact the competitive nature of a market—ensuring that the regulatory review process is informed by the best economic evidence.\n",

The topic of the event is timely. Private markets are an increasingly large portion of the overall markets. That means solutions to any of the most important issues in the markets today will naturally require consideration of the private markets and the assets that trade in them.\n",

      "\n",
      "I remember my first few days in private practice. Before joining my firm, I had intended to practice criminal law, not securities law. The learning curve was steep at first. Though I had learned about materiality and the basics of the public offering process, there is a lot you do not learn in law school. The acronyms alone could take years to master. After meetings, I sometimes found myself searching through rule text, academic articles and the Internet to glean context and background on questions or ideas we had discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things obviously get more familiar with every new experience. And the more I practiced, the more my research delved into complex and nuanced questions. But I’ve found that even as my knowledge base has grown, there will always be questions I don’t know the answer to, areas I don’t know as well as others, and issues I find confusing. Sometimes, this is because the words themselves seem to bear little resemblance to what they are describing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I spent much of my time in private practice litigating issues that had arisen in securities offerings, with plaintiffs alleging misconduct by one of the participants in the offering. Even when these were termed “private” offerings, I found that they were often sold to hundreds of different investors, often with little financial experience, and none of whom had any relationship with the company in which they were investing. I confess that this still does not make a lot of sense to me, and I have recently spoken on the topic.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, I knew what a bank was — or, I thought I did — but in the aftermath of the global financial crisis we also began to hear more and more about “shadow banks.” These non-bank entities engaged in many activities associated with the traditional banking system and thus posed similar spillover risks as depository banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadow banks function by intermediating between borrowers and investors in capital markets, but they had structured themselves in ways that allowed them to evade many of the regulations designed to prevent banks from posing undue risks to the financial system.[2] The resultant lack of oversight was a principal cause of the crisis.[3] As with private offerings, I have also spoken about this topic recently. I believe that as industries become larger, it is important to reevaluate the regulatory framework to ensure it remains fit for its purpose, and allowing parts of the financial system to operate in the shadows creates risks to investors and the financial system.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "And this brings me to today — I am growing increasingly concerned with “loans” that look less and less like loans. The syndicated loan market has grown vastly larger in recent years and the loans themselves are far different from traditional loans. Many are sold to hundreds of “passive” investors. They trade frequently and on standardized documentation. And they are used to conduct activities far beyond traditional borrowing to buy a piece of machinery or a new building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this significant growth, much of this market is not subject to meaningful regulation and investors are being put at risk. In addition, I am concerned that systemic financial issues are lurking in the market, and that if these instruments are not monitored more closely, the risk to the financial system itself will continue to grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Beginnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly where this story begins is hard to pin down. We are all familiar with the idea of lending memorialized in “It’s a Wonderful Life.” That film is certainly an easy place to think of as a starting point — customers obtained loans from a particular bank, and those loans were made using the deposits at that bank. But as the economy grew and capital needs increased, the business of lending began to shift. Banks kept lending, but more often shared the risk of large transactions with other banks as part of a syndicate. This allowed banks to maintain relationships with their customer rather than losing that customer to the bond market, but not to take on the entire credit risk on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, the link back to “It’s a Wonderful Life” has grown more attenuated. Banks or groups of banks originate loans but quickly syndicate nearly all of the risk to others, either as a participation (meaning the other party’s relationship is only with the bank, not to the underlying borrower) or an assignment (meaning the assignee has direct contractual privity with the borrower).\n",
      "\n",
      "Syndications, loan participations, and assignments are not new. But whereas in previous decades they were small scale and bespoke — with banks selling interests to a small circle of highly sophisticated institutional investors, often other banks — these practices are now supersized and systematized. We are now a far cry from banks negotiating participations or assignments of one large loan directly, and only with a handful of peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, investment banks and other financial institutions have become dominant players. These global institutions source loans from other banks and, increasingly, shadow banks and market them to a range of investors.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequently, those investors are institutions like registered investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), or other financial institutions that have large sums of money to deploy but do not have the customer relationships to make loans directly. Helpfully for these counterparties, they are not subject to bank capital regulations. One commentator called this a “symbiotic arbitrage,” with banks arranging loans they are not able to hold on their own books, but instead sell to institutional purchasers.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these changes were due to regulatory developments. For instance, discussions of this trend frequently note that the Basel framework’s risk-based capital rules pushed banks to diversify their portfolios to make them safer, and that this in turn led to banks holding less of any particular loan on their own books.[7] The impacts of the Basel framework and its successors have undoubtedly been positive overall, and have contributed to a safer, more resilient banking system. But the downsides of the originate-to-distribute model— the same model that came to grief with respect to mortgages and triggered the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 — have become more apparent over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cracks Begin to Develop\n",
      "\n",
      "As the industry approach to loan syndication continued to develop, so too did misconduct in these largely unregulated corners of the market. As I mentioned a moment ago, the market and practices of loan syndication began to change dramatically. Driven in part by pressures to compete against investment banks that were able to place short term commercial paper, banks began to market loan participations to their institutional clients.[8] These new structures did not create any relationship with the borrower through which an investor could enforce its claim. They also did not provide a mechanism for investors to conduct their own diligence or information gathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, investors were entirely dependent on the efforts of the intermediary bank, which frequently retained little or no risk. The practical result of this structure was to leave investors with no recourse against any party to the transaction, even in the case of intentional misconduct.[9] The results were sadly all too predictable. Certain companies were not able to make good on their debts and defaulted, leaving investors holding the bag with little to no recourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in a case in the late 1980s, a California bank marketed participations in loans it had made to a large company called Integrated Resources. The bank’s marketing efforts involved conduct reminiscent of boiler room scams. This included daily cold calls to market the notes to investors who had neither the means nor the ability to conduct diligence on the company. These participations were marketed as investments and looked like securities. Investors, relying on publicly available information, purchased them as yield-enhancing alternatives to money-market investments.[10] There was no other risk-reducing regulatory framework as the investors were not in privity with the underlying borrower and thus had no ability to sue it directly.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "But in Banco Espanol de Credito v. Security Pacific National Bank, the Second Circuit ruled that the investments in loan participations were not, in fact securities, and dismissed the investors’ claims.[12] The Banco Espanol opinion applied the four-part test in Reves v. Ernst & Young, which starts with the presumption that an instrument described as a note is a security, but then applies four factors to determine whether the note bears “family resemblance” to another instrument which is not a security and, if so, treats the instrument similarly.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in 1992, when the Banco Espanol opinion came down, it was clear that the opinion—which has been variously described by some critics as “puzzling,” “relatively cursory,” and “incorrect”— was meant to be narrow. The Second Circuit retreated from it almost immediately (at least in part).[14] For example, when it denied a petition for rehearing, the court narrowed the scope of its original decision to emphasize that it only ruled with respect to the particular loan participations before it, and it also emphasized that “even if an underlying instrument is not a security, the manner in which participations in that instrument are used, pooled, or marketed might establish that such participations are securities.”[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, only two years later, a different panel of the same circuit court held that participations in mortgage loans were securities, which required the panel to consider a very similar factual situation and come out the opposite way.[16] But despite the fact that the Banco Espanol opinion was controversial and narrow from the start, and was undermined by a different ruling nearly immediately, it continues to reverberate. A vibrant market for broadly syndicated loans (or “BSLs”) now exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Banco\n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways, a BSL looks like a loan to a company. Like a loan, companies can use the proceeds for any purpose, including purchasing equipment or issuing a dividend to their equity owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other ways, BSLs look more like bonds. Evidence of the obligation is generally in the form of a “note” purchased by institutional investors (not banks), such as investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds, CLOs, and various other non-bank financial institutions.[17] In addition, like a bond, a company generally will only make interest payments, with a single principal payment due all at once upon maturity.[18] BSLs are frequently structured to accommodate the market into which they are sold, and are designed to be relatively freely tradable among the institutions that invest in them.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the years since the Banco Espanol decision, the market for BSLs has continued to grow and evolve, including in ways that further undermine investor protections. Indeed, one cause of this undermining of investor protections may be the perception that federal securities laws do not apply. Recently, the SEC was asked to weigh in on whether a particular BSL met the definition of a security. The SEC did not weigh in, and the court ruled without such input.[20] While that case has now been decided, it brought new attention to an issue that had been steadily growing. But will this be the end?\n",
      "\n",
      "The default assumption under Reves is that a particular instrument marketed as note is a security, and I am concerned that the lack of clear guidance on which factors are sufficient for a BSL to rebut that presumption is resulting in market confusion.[21] This could result in a court, or the SEC, being asked to weigh in again. This matters for both investors and the markets more broadly.[22] Here’s why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investor Protection\n",
      "\n",
      "First, investor protection. I am aware that some commentators have argued that BSL investors do not need the protections of the securities laws because they are sophisticated institutions. Of course, institutional investors also need and deserve the protections of the federal securities laws. Consider the experience of institutional investors who purchased investments based on residential real estate before and during the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "And, to be clear, it is not just institutional investors. Retail investors have enormous exposure to this market. For example, many of the vehicles that purchase BSLs are registered investment companies that focus on these types of assets, and these funds represent an important component of the market for BSLs.[24] These funds, in turn, are owned by retail investors. Even if it is the case that the parties making investment decisions understand the important protections they are giving up, do the underlying investors? Funds investing in BSLs have been heavily marketed to retail investors in recent years as a hedge against rising interest rates.[25] Less prominent, however, have been discussions of the differences in legal status between BSLs and other credit instruments like bonds. I believe it is unlikely that most retail investors in these funds would understand these nuances, and that they would reasonably expect their funds to have more legal protections than in fact exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a minimum, investors benefit from the protections of the crucial antifraud rules of the federal securities laws, such as Rule 10b-5. This rule polices any materially false or misleading statements made to investors. Rule 10b-5 and other rules do more. Consider: do investors in BSLs have sufficient protection from the risks of insider trading? Investors in traditional securities benefit from the knowledge that the SEC has the power to police when insiders trade on the basis of material nonpublic information. The enhanced investor protection results in increased market efficiency because investors do not need to worry that the other side is trading on the basis of inside information.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "When a BSL issuer encounters difficulty, it is common for some of the notes it has issued to be purchased by investors specializing in “distressed” assets — that is, assets where the issuer may go bankrupt, and where a savvy investor can make a profit by understanding which parts of the issuer’s capital structure are most likely to have a recovery. These investors also seek to profit by influencing the process by which the issuer seeks new capital to avoid bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases, these distressed investors negotiate for access to nonpublic information about the issuer, which is not available to all holders of its notes. To the degree the underlying assets are not securities, investors may decide to trade on the basis of this inside information without disclosing it to the market. The future of a market rife with insider trading is concerning at best, especially for investors in funds that have not received the inside information (which generally includes the passive vehicles favored by retail investors). Investors will get hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, investors in securities rely on the vigilance of other participants in the process to ensure that an issuer discloses material information about its condition. In registered offerings, these are known as “gatekeepers,” and they exert a heavy influence in favor of investors. Of course, gatekeepers themselves can make mistakes (and we have seen lapses in the gatekeeping role lead to catastrophic results that affect the entire market).[27] As a whole, though, their influence helps promote confidence in the market by providing a second set of eyes on an issuer’s disclosures before they reach investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in unregistered offerings, where there is less of a role for a formal gatekeeper, the banks, accountants, and other service providers who participate in these offerings are motivated by the securities laws to ensure that the documents they produce are accurate and not misleading. But when the assets themselves are not registered, and are not even securities, do these participants exercise sufficient vigilance? In certain cases, we have seen that the answer is no, and that, when the participants are not subject to the securities laws, they are more willing not to disclose — and in some cases, to affirmatively hide — negative information about a company. They seem to rely on the caveat emptor doctrine that the securities laws were specifically designed to root out.[28]\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of a strong gatekeeper, documents marketing BSLs to investors frequently contain what is known in the industry as a “big boy” representation. That acknowledgment is designed to protect the bank intermediating the transaction from liability by requiring investors to represent that they have done their own diligence on the issuer of the notes. But frequently, investors have neither the means nor the time to conduct meaningful diligence. The loan is generally marketed to investors very late in the process after nearly all the terms are settled, and generally an investor’s only real choice is whether to participate. While some might argue that this is evidence of investors exhibiting rational ignorance, meaning the market is working, I think it could also be evidence of a market failure— the vehicles purchasing BSLs are doing so with other people’s money, and the bonuses of the people investing on behalf of those vehicles will be paid long before it is clear whether the BSLs at issue will perform in line with expectations.[29] This is a clear conflict. Shouldn’t the expectations of the party who will actually be harmed be given precedence?\n",
      "\n",
      "In many contexts, parties are not allowed to waive rights that are central to a particular regulatory scheme. In fact, recognizing the fundamental unfairness and power imbalances that can exist when powerful parties are able to manipulate the circumstances of a transaction, provisions in each of the major securities laws state that attempts to waive the protections of those laws are void.[30] In light of the remedial nature of the securities laws and the identity of many underlying investors, should we take a fresh look at assets that seem structured to avoid these important protections?\n",
      "\n",
      "Systemic Risk\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also concerned that risk has accumulated in the BSL market and that it may be reaching a scale that could affect the financial system more broadly.[31] These assets trade privately, preventing regulators like the SEC from fully assessing whether particular institutions have too much exposure, or whether other risks are brewing. Ultimately, the lack of these data could result in us being unable to detect risks that could affect the efficiency, fairness, or orderliness of our capital markets. And, if a negative outcome does ultimately occur, the same lack of data could also hamper our ability to effectively respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse, the types of BSLs that look most similar to securities also seem to have characteristics that make them especially likely to have procyclical systemic effects on the market. Though BSLs trade regularly, many passive investors will only buy assets that trade on “par docs.” This essentially means that they are not trading at a discount due to distress or potential distress at the borrower. In fact, many investors have strict guidelines that require them to sell BSLs even when they are downgraded below a certain level — well before the issuer is truly in distress. I am concerned that this can result in a procyclical cycle of sales which in turn could cause forced sales of other BSLs market-wide and affect the ability of companies to receive financing even though they are not otherwise distressed. The echoes of the 2008 financial crisis are hard to ignore.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, as BSLs grow larger, they naturally need to be syndicated to more participants. But this also renders them especially vulnerable if problems develop. If investors sour on the market, (for example due to forced sales by market participants depressing prices throughout the market), the largest loans that depend on being especially widely syndicated are the ones that are most likely to get “hung” on bank balance sheets and potentially affect financing to other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we continue to move into a new era of higher interest rates, these effects may become more apparent. For example, many companies took advantage of the near-zero interest rates of the pandemic and its immediate aftermath to borrow new money using BSLs. The amount of BSLs maturing in the next several years is more than any other comparable period in history.[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "Though it is still early innings, we are already seeing indications of what could happen when companies crash into this maturity wall. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, many companies engaged in “extend and pretend” transactions. These involved extending the maturity of the company’s debt on the hope that financial conditions would improve but without any meaningful changes to the company’s business. As of earlier this year, extend and pretend transactions were at their highest on record.[33] Though it appears this has not yet resulted in immediate negative effects, will our luck run out in future years?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the traditional passive investors in BSLs are not well-equipped to handle decisions requiring analysis of the issuer’s business prospects. This has led to the rise of the “snooze drag,” where CLOs strategically do not take action on extension requests (allowing them to take effect by default).[34] This has resulted in investor complaints because the CLOs would otherwise be required to return their investors’ money.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, a situation where many borrowers are seeking to refinance by extending their existing loans without any real changes, and can only do so by convincing their lenders to “snooze” is a flashing warning sign – what happens when borrowers’ ability to engage in this tactic runs out? Will procyclical forced sales occur? And will regulators and the public be caught by surprise when this begins to affect the real economy?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that the two dynamics I have mentioned — investor protection and systemic risk – are interconnected. Markets in which securities protections are not present mean investors have less information, less confidence in the integrity of the information they do have, and fewer assurances that market participants will not abuse the trust investors place in them.[35] Without these rules, the market runs a higher risk of unraveling, with potentially systemic consequences for the real economy.[36] Greater disclosure and the greater integrity of disclosure that comes with antifraud rules, protections against insider trading, and gatekeepers would guard against the BSL market becoming a proverbial “market for lemons.”[37]\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * * *\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also like briefly to touch on several other areas that commentators have raised when discussing whether particular instruments described as notes, such as BSLs, should be regulated as securities. Though I believe consideration of these policy issues would not alter the application of the binding Supreme Court precedent in Reves, I believe they could merit some consideration so that regulators and the industry can work together to develop guidance on areas that may be unclear. In the face of uncertainty about the future development of the BSL market, it could be that regulators have work to do to prepare for a future ruling that certain BSLs are securities for purposes of the Securities Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, BSLs are frequently originated by large, national banks. I am aware that these banks are generally prohibited from underwriting securities, and that some have argued that if a court were to deem these widely syndicated notes securities, it could reduce capital formation. I believe further work is necessary to determine whether this is a realistic concern. Are there other arrangements a bank could make, such as conducting the activity through an affiliate? Would doing so require any additional regulatory actions from the SEC or banking regulators?\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, these assets are already defined as securities for some purposes and not for others. For example, they are already treated as securities under the Investment Company Act.[38] What would prevent a banking regulator from issuing guidance stating that it would not deem widely syndicated loans to be securities for the purposes of the Volcker rule, even though the assets would be securities for other purposes?\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * * *\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout my remarks today, I have referred to the global financial crisis of 2008. In the years leading up to that crisis, financial institutions had successfully convinced regulators that the laws and regulations enacted in the wake of the Great Depression could be loosened. They were able to point to decades without a crisis to argue that strict regulations were unnecessary and that the business of banking had become safer. Just over 25 years ago, the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management failed. Until its failure, many believed that hedge funds did not to pose a risk to the financial system.[39] This was because investments in these vehicles were privately placed to sophisticated investors who were capable of sustaining large losses. LTCM was run by Wall Street legends (including several Nobel laureates) who were viewed as some of the brightest minds in finance. But despite the apparent safety, the firm melted down over the course of a few weeks and ultimately required a multi-billion dollar bailout from its counterparties (at the strong urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York).[40] Its failure is one reminder that the non-occurrence of a crisis does not mean that one could never occur in the future. Regulators must be vigilant about the risks that are around the corner, not just the ones in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am aware that some may argue that BSLs have only exhibited isolated problems, and that these problems alone are not necessarily evidence of systemic risk. It could be the case that this means BSLs will never cause systemic issues in the financial system. But, as in the years leading up to 2008, a metamorphosis in the system may be occurring before our eyes. I worry that this market is becoming riskier in ways that regulators have not yet fully considered. While some loan syndication may make sense to reduce the risk taken by individual banks, I am concerned that we are now in a world where banks lend, but nearly all the risk is transferred to investors who have no relationship with the borrower, and that investors — including retail investors — frequently have a great deal of exposure to these assets.[41] If that is to be the case, regulators across the board must assess whether investors have sufficient protection, and whether there are other risks to consider. For example, is the risk of BSLs compounded due to the lack of transparency, price discovery, and regulation of the private offerings through which BSLs are distributed to investors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Consideration of these issues now, before further problems develop, is necessary. Doing so allows us to ensure that a crisis does not threaten the fair, orderly, and efficient markets that we strive to maintain. I look forward to working with the public — including the people in this room today — to ensure that these outcomes do not occur. Thank you.\n",

The words ‘authentic’ and ‘local’ could be heard ringing around delegate’s ears by the final day. One of the best-attended panels featured senior bods from Mediawan, Sony, Studiocanal and Universal International Studios, and optimism about Europe was the name of that game. Mediawan’s Elisabeth D’Arvieu said European production now has a “big competitive advantage” over America and panellists listed a wealth of reasons why, including tax credits, favorable production hubs, local broadcasting ecologies and a “cost-effective pool of talent.” The notion of Europeans “selling into the U.S” and boosting exports in that direction was raised on several occasions. There are of course the aforementioned financing issues and plenty of strife remains with economies in flux but European delegates were showing serious resolve. As if on cue, CBS Studios unveiled Icelandic series The Darkness from Lasse Hallström, starring Enemies, A Love Story and Hunters star Lena Olin. As if on further cue, enter the New8…\n",

      "Reports of the death of public broadcasting have always been greatly exaggerated. In amongst virtually all U.S. streamers facing existential questions, these paragons of local culture have held firm and have been doing what they do best, and now they are collaborating big time. MIA’s big announcement came via a Tuesday press conference and unveiling of “the biggest drama collaboration in Europe,” as pubcasters in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium signed a contract to join the five Nordic broadcasters who make up the Nordic Twelve to form the New8. While confused journalists were left scratching their heads at how three plus 12 could possibly equal eight, bosses from each PSB spoke with confidence about how they will go about collaborating on eight TV series a year, which will be available in each member country. They will meet four times per year and submit projects to be funded by each territory, with four coming from the Nordics, two from Germany and one each from Belgium and the Netherlands. There was palpable excitement. Deadline spoke with execs throughout the week who were impressed with the resolve but met the New8 with a dose of scepticism, preferring to keep powder dry until projects begin to emerge and pondering the deeper ins-and-outs of the partnership or how it can avoid bureaucratic nightmare. But, more broadly, public broadcasting is felt to be in a good place. “We are staying relevant in a highly competitive landscape and fulfilling audience expectations,” said the drama financing boss of Norway’s NRK. A report into the local Italian industry is due out later today.\n",

      "Don’t forget animation\n",
      "\n",
      "In a canny move, MIA devoted more energy to animation and factual TV this year, broadening a market that has previously leaned on scripted. Various panels debated the topics of the day in animation and there were pitching sessions to help discover the next generation of talent. Flying the animated flag was Marge Dean, a doyen of the genre who runs Walking Dead maker Skybound Entertainment’s Animation Studio. She argued passionately on day one for animation to be given a seat at the top table, breaking free “from the kids and comedy box that it has been stuck in for decades.” Dean had a ready-made example, Amazon Prime Video’s Invincible, a show that had a budget four times less than the Boys with “barely” any marketing and yet regularly hits the streamer’s top-five most watched, she said. Dean also dismissed the AI threat, finding: “It’s only a danger to creativity if we let it be.” With question marks over scripted financing (they never stop) and anime and adult animation proving popular on streaming platforms, more networks may think about taking up Dean’s mantra as we enter 2024.\n",

      "It has been a sombre week for the international community. As delegates were heading to Rome, Hamas was attacking Israel and kidnapping dozens of citizens. Israel has long punched above its weight in TV and film and MIA recognized this, with talk of the growing conflict not dying down throughout the week. Oscar-nominated Waltz with Bashir director Ari Folman was due to keynote on animated docs but pulled out as the confab started. He was then due to address delegates remotely but this was also cancelled. Next week’s Mipcom Cannes looks set to further highlight the plight of the Israeli and Palestinian communities in a conflict that the international community is beginning to understand will not be ending anytime soon. While the brunt of the Israeli delegation is no longer going to Mipcom, there will still be representatives from Israeli media companies who are based in other nations, and there will be plenty to discuss. For now, the world mourns.\n",

      "Our call of the day comes from Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, who says the stock market is finding a lot of competition these days as investors seek out better alternatives, and that could be holding the market back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comments came via an interview with Bianco by Hedgeye Risk Management’s CEO Keith McCullough at the Hedgeye Investing Summit on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Bianco points to a study from the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices that showed how over many, many years, the stock market will return 9% for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Okay, I can get 5.5% [return] without taking any without taking any risks by putting it in a money market or buying a six-month T-bill. That’s over half of the gain…or maybe approaching two-thirds of the game that I would get over a long term in the stock market without any risks. Is that incremental extra 1/3 worth all the risk that I need to take? A lot of people say ‘no,’ and that’s why you see massive inflows into money-market funds,” says Bianco.\n",
      "\n",
      "He says things are different now and it’s not like 2019, when the big argument was TINA — or there is no alternative to the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategists pointed to other cards stacked against stocks, such as the lopsidedness caused by the seven Magnificent Seven tech darlings — Apple AAPL, -0.07% , Microsoft MSFT, +1.50% , Alphabet GOOGL, +1.26% , Amazon AMZN, +2.13% , Nvidia NVDA, +1.39% , Tesla TSLA, +1.12% and Meta Platforms META, +2.05% . .\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why is everything but seven stocks struggling? Because everybody’s sitting there looking at a 5.5% [return] with no risk and they are saying, ‘You know, call me when there is going to be a better opportunity in the market because right now I’m just happy taking my 5.5% an sleeping well,'” says Bianco.\n",

      "\n",
      "Published on October 11, 2023\n",
      "\n",
      "Arlington County has launched the next phase of its efforts to proactively address the structural changes in the commercial market and the impacts office vacancy has on County revenue, seeking to remove regulatory barriers to market-based solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlington County Board held a work session on Oct. 10, 2023, to hear the County Manager and staff’s initial approach to the Commercial Market Resiliency Initiative (CMRI) 2.0, which will build on the work the County has been doing for the past year. Since 2022, the County Board has established several new uses for commercial buildings—urban agriculture, research and development, commercial and ghost kitchens, and micro-fulfillment centers, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "RELATED: Read frequently asked questions about CMRI\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in our commercial market that has fundamentally changed how people work and how businesses operate, both in Arlington and nationally,\" Board Chair Christian Dorsey said. \"Our challenge is to adapt to this new environment while leveraging all that makes Arlington great. The CMRI 2.0 continues our commitment to modernizing our approach to Arlington's regulations and processes, and to working quickly to find solutions that ensure our community remains resilient and world-class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, Arlington had close to a 50/50 split in its tax revenue between commercial property taxes and residential property taxes. As more workers enter a hybrid or remote model, more companies are letting leases expire or downsizing their office space. These office vacancies impact the value of commercial buildings, which affects property taxes. A decline in commercial property taxes shifts more of the tax burden to residential property owners. When revenues decrease, County services and programs that benefit everyone are impacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "MORE: CMRI Fact Sheet\n",
      "\n",
      "CMRI 2.0 is designed to address the changing commercial and fiscal reality. It will focus on five strategic areas: office conversion, repositioning, redevelopment, tenant support, and placemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff has identified several workstreams that will allow the County to work on all strategic areas simultaneously. The workstreams include planning processes (Special GLUP Studies, minor and major Site Plan amendments), the sign ordinance, parking regulations, green building incentives, and conversion of office buildings, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The workstreams will not be considering wholesale changes to existing policies or regulations. Instead, they will examine specific areas where increased flexibility could result in new opportunities to stabilize and improve the commercial portion of the County’s tax base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each workstream will have its own timeline and community engagement with stakeholders, both of which will be guided by the subject matter and its potential impact on the community. Items will be brought before the County Board incrementally, with the first one not expected until 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "County Manager Mark Schwartz noted, “For us to thrive, we need to respond quickly and thoughtfully to the new market. We welcome input from residents and commercial property owners. I am convinced we can adjust our approach, but it will only happen with changes to some of our practices and by working with the community to ensure we remain true to the vision of the County.”\n",

      "WEST LOOP — Over the past two years, Fulton Market has missed out on more than 500 affordable units as developers skirt a city goal to provide more affordable housing in the booming neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the city lifted a decades-long ban on new residential developments north of Lake Street in Fulton Market, opening a new frontier of housing in an area that had been largely restricted to office, hotel and commercial buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moratorium’s end allows residential development within what’s known as the Kinzie Corridor Overlay District, an area bounded by Ogden Avenue, Carroll Avenue, Hubbard Street, Halsted and Wayman Streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In lifting the ban, the Chicago Plan Commission, Department of Housing and Department of Planning and Development set a goal of 30 percent affordable housing units for new residential developments inside the Fulton Market Innovation District north of Lake Street. Chicago’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance currently mandates 20 percent of units are affordable citywide.\n",
      "\n",
      "From 2021 to 2022, residential development proposals were expected to “cooperate with the City in good faith” to apply for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction of the additional 10 percent in affordable units. This agreement was laid out in every development proposal approved by the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "But none of the seven developments approved by City Council from 2021 to 2022 located north of Lake Street in the Fulton Market Innovation District attained subsidies to build additional affordable units beyond the 20 percent already mandated by the city, according to the Department of Housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Area of the Fulton Market Innovation District located North of Lake Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extension of the Kinzie Industrial Corridor Tax-Increment Financing (TIF) District at the end of 2022 opened up a whole new funding source for developers to offset the cost of the additional 10 percent affordable units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four projects approved this year north of Lake Street in the Fulton Market Innovation District have not applied for the TIF subsidy, according to the Department of Housing. All four were approved by City Council with 20 percent affordability.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that changed after local Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) found out the city wasn’t delivering on its promise to bring 30 percent affordability to the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burnett told Block Club Chicago he was disappointed the city’s development team and developers were not delivering on the city’s stated 30 percent goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel bamboozled because I’m assuming that they were getting what they asked for,” Burnett said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a September Planning Commission meeting, Burnett revealed he intervened to ensure the most recent proposal for the district, at 800 W. Lake St., would include 30 percent affordable units. The 36-story building by Ascend Real Estate Group, once imagined as a hotel, will feature 406 apartments, and 122 of them will be affordable if the subsidy comes through.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None of those other buildings that we voted on, have committed to those [30 percent] aspirations because the city hasn’t committed to their part of the aspiration where they [were] supposed to subsidize,” Burnett said. ” … We need to change something. Because as far as I’m concerned, it’s a hoax.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) at a City Council meeting at City Hall on June 21, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burnett said he’s disappointed he has to stay on top of the city to incorporate its own affordable housing goals in new developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I got to not only baby developers, but I got to stay on the city’s housing department,” Burnett told Block Club Chicago. “We need to try to come up with our portion of the deal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials with the city’s Department of Housing said the issue is nuanced. Developers have not secured subsidies because those chose not to apply after learning about their options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to a break from Springfield, developers citywide who build required affordable units on-site qualify for a reduction on their property tax assessment. In exchange for the tax break, the units must remain affordable for 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tax break has led to a boom in affordable units that will come online in the next three to four years Downtown and across the West Loop. But developers haven’t been willing to pull the trigger on 30 percent affordability for proposals north of Lake Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before TIF funding became an option, developers could also apply for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit allows property owners to claim tax credits in return for making part of a development affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But regulations with the tax credit would make it hard, and in some cases impossible, for developers to sell the building after it’s completed. After learning about the subsidy through the city, the seven developers did not apply for it, according to Daniel Hertz, director of policy research and legislative affairs for the Department of Housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers found the tax credit can create issues with resale “or it’s too complex. It takes too long,” Hertz said.\n",
      "\n",
      "People walking through Fulton Market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers for the seven proposals approved between 2021-2022, did not respond to requests for comment. They include Sterling Bay, LG Development, Fulton St. Companies, Trammell Crow and Shapack Partners. Combined, these developments bypassed including about 270 additional affordable units under the 30 percent goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four developments approved this year have yet to attain building permits and are still able to apply for TIF subsidies. They are located at 1300 W. Carroll Ave., 1300 W. Lake St., 375 N. Morgan St. and 370, 400-01 N. Morgan St. Combined, these developments could provide an additional 287 affordable units under the stated 30 percent goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Block Club Chicago reached out to developers associated with these four proposals, none of them responded to request for comment on applying for the available TIF subsidy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In total with the developments, 5,609 units were approved but developers passed on making 557 of them affordable to meet the 30 percent goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Housing has contacted all four developers to discuss the possibility of applying for TIF funding to fund the additional affordable units, city officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In general, the use of TIF requires a supplemental multi-family affordable housing TIF application, which must be submitted at least six months prior to the first vertical building permit,” a Department of Housing spokesperson said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process starts with a review from the the city’s internal TIF Investment Committee, and then goes to the Community Development Commission, City Council’s finance committee and eventually the full City Council for approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed development at 800 W. Lake St. by Ascend Real Estate Group — which has yet to be approved by City Council — is the only development to attempt to tap into TIF funding to achieve 30 percent affordability.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you can pull surplus out of the TIF to balance the budget, you can pull surplus out of the TIF to build affordable housing,” Burnett said.\n",

      "\n",
      "“… If we can find agreement with Council, Department of Housing, Law Department, and administration … we would look at putting that forward as a template version of what the ARO and TIF obligations could result in … in Fulton market,” Murphey said at a September meeting. “There are a lot of ‘ifs’ in there.”\n",

      "Show Caption Hide Caption Mid Ohio Food Collective opens food lockers Mid Ohio Food Collective opens food lockers to serve people working odd hours, rural locations\n",
      "\n",
      "Some families in central Ohio may find it hard to get to a local food pantry during when they are open, which is one of the reasons the Mid-Ohio Food Collective is launching a new way to get fresh food, no matter the hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collective announced Tuesday that it is launching new refrigerated food lockers at its Market at Norton Road on Columbus' Far West Side. The lockers will allow customers to pick up their food when it's convenient for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When healthy food options are convenient, more people can use and benefit from them. The result is better health outcomes for the community,\" Mid-Ohio Food Collective President and CEO Matt Habash said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food collective has expanded its hours and locations in the past several years, but this new service will broaden access for local people even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time the collective is offering the locker service and they believe it is the first of its kind in Ohio, though in recent months food pantries across the nation have begun to introduce similar systems. They can also be found in some grocery stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's our new experiment in serving people in our community,\" Habash said on Tuesday. \"It's a way for us to serve. ... A new way to be truly customer centric.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lockers aren't meant to replace the choice included in a shopping experience at a Mid-Ohio Market, instead it's for those who aren't able to get to the market during its opening hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoppers can use the system for free by ordering online at www.orderahead.org and then being assigned a locker number, a pick-up window and a PIN to get their items. Orders are refrigerated and secure until pickup and include a variety of refrigerated items, like produce, and shelf-stable foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the city grows, not all rise: Can Columbus turn the tide of rising homelessness and food insecurity? Officials think so\n",
      "\n",
      "“This system will make it easier for working families in Columbus to get fresh, healthy food at times that work for their busy schedules,\" Habash said.\n",
      "\n",
      "After being tested, the 72 lockers are now available to the wider community, with the potential of offering three dozen families per day food access.\n",
      "\n",
      "The orange lockers and green vestibule are located on the side of the Norton Road Market, emblazoned with the words: \"Your groceries. At your convenience. Cool and fresh.\" on them in English and Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humana Healthy Horizons, a health plan that manages Medicaid benefits for thousands of Ohioans, invested money to make the lockers possible, according to the food collective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan's partnership with the collective includes more than $1.25 million focusing on ending hunger by addressing social determinants of food insecurity and poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collective reported seeing an \"unprecedented\" need and record demand for food across its 680 partner sites in 20 area counties earlier this year. From Jan. 1 to Oct. 1, people received food assistance at its locations more than 1.3 million times, according to the collective's data, up 35% from the same time in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Unprecedented' need: Central Ohio food banks, pantries experiencing 40% increase in demand\n",
      "\n",
      "Humana and the collective hosted a public launch and ribbon cutting event Tuesday at the Norton Road market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humana Healthy Horizons is committed to eliminating the barriers that impact the health of the communities we serve,” said Kathie Mancini, vice president of Humana Healthy Horizons - Ohio, in a statement. “By working with MOFC on vital programs like this one, we can help ensure everyone in the mid-Ohio region has access to healthy, nourishing food.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the food collective hopes to put the lockers in other locations, including rural areas where pantry hours may be more limited. There are also discussions about putting a set at the new COTA Rickenbacker Mobility Center, Habash said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It really lives into what we call a food is health strategy,\" Habash said, during the ribbon cutting event. \"The ability to really connect people is what this has ben all about.\"\n",
