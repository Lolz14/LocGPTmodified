REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON/BOGOTA, Oct 10 (Reuters) - When Vernon Hill launched Metro Bank in 2010, his Yorkshire terrier tucked under one arm, he vowed the upstart lender would challenge the dominance of Britain's big banks.\n\nBut the challenger banks have struggled to shake up a market dominated by the \"Big Four\" of Lloyds (LLOY.L), NatWest (NWG.L), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Barclays (BARC.L), with Metro's eleventh-hour weekend capital injection highlighting the hurdles they face.\n\nWhile Metro, which used to offer dog biscuits for customers' pets, was Britain's first new high street bank in more than 150 years, it was soon followed by other new entrants, such as fast-growing digital lenders Monzo and Starling Bank.\n\nAlthough Metro's refinancing package will see its shareholders heavily diluted and some bondholders take a haircut, markets welcomed the deal, with the bank's battered shares gaining 11% on Monday and climbing further on Tuesday.\n\n\"Maybe it's just the least worst outcome now and a bitter pill that just needs to be necked,\" said John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody.\n\nCreditors also appear in favour of the deal, with support secured just shy of the 75% threshold needed as of Monday, two sources familiar with the situation said.\n\nBondholders include Caius Capital, Kite Lake and Varde Partners, another source said. All three declined to comment.\n\nMetro declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nThe fundraising package will also hand Metro's biggest shareholder, the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski, a controlling stake in the bank. Gilinski, whose daughter Dorita is on Metro's board, will inject 102 million pounds to take a 53% stake.\n\nThe engineer and Harvard graduate - who is Colombia's fourth richest man with a fortune of $5 billion, according to Forbes - has further ambitions.\n\nA source with knowledge of the matter said Gilinski planned to acquire further UK banking assets over time and was monitoring other opportunities, building on his experiences buying a string of banks in Latin America.\n\n'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD'\n\nBritish regulators and lawmakers have long wanted the challengers to take on the bigger banks, but progress has been slow as they have largely failed to achieve the scale needed.\n\nWhile some have made a dent in the current account market - with Monzo for instance amassing 8.4 million customers - few have entered or made real headway in key markets such as mortgage lending.\n\nBritain's 10 largest mortgage lenders still accounted for 83% of the market at the end of last year, data published by banking trade body UK Finance shows.\n\nMonzo declined to comment.\n\nA Starling spokesperson said the lender was making inroads into the big banks' market dominance.\n\n\"We've demonstrated that we can scale,\" the spokesperson said. \"We reported profits of 195 million pounds for the year to the end of March 2023, the second full consecutive year of profitability.\"\n\nSome challengers have criticized Britain's capital rules for hampering competition, leading the Bank of England to pledge to introduce a \"strong and simple\" capital regime for smaller banks, although the reform has yet to be implemented.\n\nTwo sources close to Metro said the capital rules had been a key contributing factor to its problems, which began in the years after it floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2016.\n\n\"There has to be a level playing field,\" one added.\n\nAfter failing to obtain key capital relief and faced with looming debt maturities, Metro last month enlisted Morgan Stanley to advise it, people familiar with the move said.\n\nThe Bank of England then stepped in to find potential buyers for Metro in case refinancing talks failed, which could have been more painful for investors, the people added.\n\nBritain's principal banking regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), declined to comment.\n\nBut some of Metro's problems were of its own making, said Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, such as an accounting error in 2019 that ultimately led to Hill's departure as chairman and marked a turning point for the bank.\n\nAlthough many of the major setbacks were behind it before its 925 million pound ($1.1 billion) financing package, Metro's share price was down 98% from the time of its float.\n\nSome analysts say several problems remain for Metro, including a high-cost branch model, but the bank is betting a shift into higher margin lending, including specialist mortgages and commercial loans, will pay off.\n\nReuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\n\nCONSOLIDATION?\n\nTough economic conditions are clouding the outlook for the challenger banks, in some cases raising concerns around potential loan losses and high funding costs.\n\n\"It's hard to see how investors will rally behind (smaller players),\" said Rupak Ghose, corporate strategist and former financials analyst.\n\nInterest rate rises have also bumped up the costs of attracting customer deposits, particularly for those reliant on interest-paying savings accounts, and intensified competition.\n\nShore Capital's Greenwood said most challenger banks were profitable and had proven adaptable, but said higher rates could pressure less specialised lenders.\n\nMarkets regulator the Financial Conduct Authority said competition had increased in the banking sector and it was continuing its work to improve this.\n\nMetro is not the only smaller bank to have faced problems.\n\nIn July, shares in OSB Group (OSBO.L) slid after the midsize specialist lender said it would take a hit of up to 180 million pounds due to changing customer behaviour.\n\nOSB Group declined to comment.\n\nOne option is for smaller banks to gain scale through mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\"Is consolidation the only hope?\" said Ghose.\n\nOne bank which is actively pursuing a sale is Co-op Bank, which invited bids by last week, with rival Shawbrook tabling an indicative offer, Reuters reported.\n\nCo-op Bank and Shawbrook declined to comment.\n\nBut deals could be tough to strike, as buyers have to mark down assets due to rising interest rates, one source said.\n\nFor Metro, the latest funding will likely put it in a stronger position should M&A interest re-emerge, they added.\n\nSuch decisions will now lie in the hands of Gilinski, as he looks to make further waves in UK banking.\n\n($1 = 0.8155 pound)\n\nReporting by Iain Withers, Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro, Anousha Sakoui, Huw Jones, Amy-Jo Crowley, Sinead Cruise and Chiara Elisei in London and by Nelson Bocanegra in Bogota;

They fell short of agreeing to a U.S. plan that would delay shareholding changes that would cede more influence to China, with more talks in the next two months.\n\nThe World Bank's governing body approved its new vision statement to \"create world free of poverty on a liveable planet,\" incorporating its new mission to tackle climate change, and endorsed new steps to allow the use of debt-like hybrid capital and a new portfolio guarantee platform that could together yield up to $100 billion in new lending over a decade.\n\nNO CONSENSUS ON MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT\n\nHamas' attack on Israel upset a carefully crafted script for the meetings, but IMF and World Bank leaders were slow to respond to risks presented by the conflict, ranging from higher energy prices, potential trade impacts and a new refugee crisis.\n\nG20 finance leaders and the steering committees of both institutions also failed to issue joint communiques due to disagreement over Russia's invasion of Ukraine war, but unlike the strong condemnation of the Hamas attacks by G7 democracies, the larger, more diverse groups failed to mention the Middle East conflict\n\n'LIMPING' ECONOMY\n\nThe new IMF outlook - signed off before the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas - sees global economic growth slowing from 3.5% last year to 3% this year and 2.9% next year, a 0.1% point downgrade from a previous 2024 estimate.\n\nGlobal inflation is seen dropping from 6.9% this year to a still-high 5.8% next. Central bankers signalled readiness to end interest rate hikes if events allow, hopeful that inflation can be finally tamed without too hard a landing. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas described the global economy as \"limping along, not sprinting\".\n\nDEBT SQUEEZE\n\nThe heavy debt burdens of advanced economies - from the United States to China and Italy - was a recurrent theme in the meetings, which came after financial markets in recent weeks pushed U.S. bond yields higher. Italian central bank governor Ignazio Visco said there was an impression markets were \"reevaluating the term premium\" as investors become more nervous about holding longer term debt.\n\nJPMorgan chair of global research Joyce Chang put it another way. \"The bond vigilantes are back, and the Great Moderation is over,\" she told a panel of the two-decade era of relative economic calm before the 2008/09 financial crisis.\n\nOne policy area where this could have a knock-on effect is the fight against climate change. Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMF's fiscal division, warned current subsidies-based policies were failing to deliver net zero emissions and that scaling them up would explode public debt without carbon pricing to generate revenue.\n\nDEBT DEALS AND REFORMS\n\nLooking beyond the major developed economies, higher policy rates, a strong dollar and geopolitical uncertainties are adding to challenges for the rest of the world.\n\nTurkey was in the spotlight as Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek pitched its reform plan. \"The biggest structural issue is to bring inflation down. And they're working on it,\" said Murat Ulgen, Global Head of Emerging Markets Research at HSBC.\n\nKenya is looking to avoid slipping into debt distress and its central bank governor told Reuters it plans a buyback of a quarter of its $2 billion international bond maturing in June - pushing its 2024 bond up 1.2 cents on the dollar.\n\nOne debt restructuring deal emerged: Zambia finally agreed a debt rework memorandum of understanding with creditors including China and France.\n\nProgress on Sri Lanka was less clear. Sri Lanka said on Thursday it reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China covering about $4.2 billion of debt, while talks with other official creditors are stalling.\n\nRISKS SKEWED TO DOWNSIDE\n\nHigh interest rates will put some borrowers in more precarious positions, the IMF warned in its Global Financial Stability Report. Around 5% of banks globally are vulnerable to stress if those rates remain higher for longer, it estimated, and a further 30% of banks - including some of the world's largest - would be vulnerable if the global economy enters a prolonged period of low growth and high inflation.\n\nJOSTLING FOR INFLUENCE\n\nThe Ukraine war, growing trade protectionism and tensions between the United States and China are all making consensus-building tougher. There was much talk ahead of Marrakech on revamping the IMF and World Bank to better reflect the emergence of economies like China and Brazil, but actions taken at the meetings may delay them.\n\n\"The big theme this week is G7 countries papering over the cracks of shattered promises,\" said Kate Donald, Head of Oxfam International's Washington DC Office. \"Despite the wringing of hands about the billions of dollars needed to tackle poverty and climate breakdown, there has been no sign of new money.\"\n\nReporting in Marrakech by Ahmed El Jechtimi, Andrea Shalal, David Lawder, Leika Kihara, Elisa Martinuzzi, Rachel Savage, Jorgelina do Rosario, Balazs Koranyi; Compiled by Mark John; Editing by Christina Fincher\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "Statement by World Bank President Ajay Banga, IMF Managing ... - International Monetary Fund", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 17:25:36 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.imf.org", "title": "International Monetary Fund"}, "text": "Statement by World Bank President Ajay Banga, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Morocco\u2019s Minister of Economy and Finance Nadia Fettah, and Bank Al\u2011Maghrib Governor Abdellatif Jouahri on the Marrakech Principles for Global Cooperation\n\nMarrakech, Morocco: On the occasion of the 2023 World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meetings in Marrakech, the World Bank President Ajay Banga; IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva; Kingdom of Morocco Minister of Economy and Finance Nadia Fettah; and Bank Al\u2011Maghrib Governor Abdellatif Jouahri, today issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cAs the global community gathers in Marrakech, we need to stand together, united in the goal of protecting our future prosperity and ending extreme poverty. Prospects for global growth in the medium-term are at their lowest level in decades. The scarring effects of successive crises are increasingly apparent, just as many countries are struggling to overcome high inflation, high debt, and significant financing shortfalls to provide basic services, support infrastructure and climate action, and address rising poverty, inequality, and fragility.\n\n\u201cThe world has become more shock-prone, with increased risks to growth, development, jobs, and living standards that widen inequalities within and across countries. Emerging market and developing economies have been especially hard hit. Income divergence with advanced economies has deepened further, and the world is not on a path to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.\n\n\u201cOur understanding of the major risks and disruptive forces facing the global economy has evolved: the existential threat posed by climate change, growing disparities in income and opportunity, and geopolitical tensions are intensifying. Rapid digitalization and technological transformations create new challenges, but also opportunities, and no country should be left behind.\n\n\u201cMarrakech 2023 is a call for enhanced global collaborative action on common challenges, so we can build resilience and expand opportunities for a better future.\n\n\u201cThese 4 Marrakech Principles for Global Cooperation provide a broad framework to help harness the power of multilateralism to the benefit of all.\n\n*****\n\n1. Reinvigorating Inclusive and Sustainable Growth\n\nPromoting growth-enhancing structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance, the rule of law, trade, and the business environment to attract new investment and generate jobs.\n\nExpanding financing sources by boosting domestic resource mobilization, upscaling the provision and effective use of concessional resources, leveraging donor resources, fostering foreign direct investment, and catalyzing private sector finance, while improving public expenditure efficiency.\n\nAddressing fragility by effectively utilizing mechanisms for supporting fragile and conflict-affected states and jointly addressing global sources of food and energy insecurity.\n\n2. Building Resilience\n\nStrengthening institutional capacity by building stronger institutions and policy frameworks with support from international organizations.\n\nMaintaining external stability by pursuing sound macroeconomic policies and avoiding disruptive spillovers to other countries.\n\nStrengthening public debt management and resolution frameworks by enhancing external and domestic debt management and improving the efficiency and timeliness of debt restructuring processes.\n\nEnhancing global crisis preparedness and mitigation by increasing the resilience of supply chains, strengthening pandemic preparedness, strengthening financial sectors, undertaking timely macroeconomic adjustments, building adaptive social protection, and reinforcing the Global Financial Safety Net.\n\nDecoupling growth from climate risk by developing capacities to manage and implement cost-effective strategies for disaster risk reduction and planning, enabling construction and maintenance of climate and disaster shock resilient infrastructure, strengthening regional efforts against ecological challenges that might lead to forced migration, including by preserving biodiversity, and promoting sustainable land and water management practices.\n\n3. Supporting Transformational Reforms\n\nAccelerating the green transition through determined efforts by all countries to advance decarbonization of their economies based on the principles the Paris Agreement, while ensuring energy security throughout the transition.\n\nManaging technological transformations to avoid digital fragmentation, narrow the digital divide, facilitate creation of modernized, efficient domestic and cross-border payment systems and foster financial inclusion. Internationally harmonized rules and regulations must also be developed in tandem on crypto assets, data protection, cyber security, and artificial intelligence.\n\nEnhancing health systems and preparedness through collaborative work towards enhancing global health security by improving universal health coverage, strengthening health systems, and establishing global mechanisms to ensure equitable access to vaccines and medications.\n\nPromoting equitable and quality education to advance global efforts toward inclusive and equitable quality education, broadening access to early childhood, primary, and secondary education, and boosting quality to ensure learning in the classroom.\n\nBuilding gender equality to expand and enable economic opportunities, empower, and engage women as leaders.\u201d\n\n4. Strengthening and Modernizing Global Cooperation\n\nStrengthening the international monetary system and its rules, conventions, and institutions to respond to countries\u2019 needs and to facilitate cross-border trade, payments, and investment flows.\n\nStrengthening the multilateral trading system to support global economic cooperation and growth by ensuring that it is rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, sustainable, and transparent with effective dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\nEnhancing collaboration, as the IMF and the World Bank are committed to working closely together and with partners to help member countries address challenges and leverage opportunities."}, {"title": "Key takeaways from the IMF-World Bank meetings - CNBC", "date": "Sat, 14 Oct 2023 15:39:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnbc.com", "title": "CNBC"}, "text": "U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen arrives for a bilateral meeting on the third day of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meeting, in Marrakech, Morocco, October 11, 2023.

Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nAmerican banks are closing out another quarter in which interest rates surged, reviving concerns about shrinking margins and rising loan losses \u2014 though some analysts see a silver lining to the industry's woes. Just as they did during the March regional banking crisis, higher rates are expected to lead to a jump in losses on banks' bond portfolios and contribute to funding pressures as institutions are forced to pay higher rates for deposits. KBW analysts Christopher McGratty and David Konrad estimate banks' per-share earnings fell 18% in the third quarter as lending margins compressed and loan demand sank on higher borrowing costs. \"The fundamental outlook is hard near term; revenues are declining, margins are declining, growth is slowing,\" McGratty said in a phone interview. Earnings season kicks off Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo . Bank stocks have been intertwined closely with the path of borrowing costs this year. The S&P 500 Banks index sank 9.3% in September on concerns sparked by a surprising surge in longer-term interest rates, especially the 10-year yield, which jumped 74 basis points in the quarter. Rising yields mean the bonds owned by banks fall in value, creating unrealized losses that pressure capital levels. The dynamic caught midsized institutions including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic off guard earlier this year, which \u2014 combined with deposit runs \u2014 led to government seizure of those banks.\n\nBig banks have largely dodged concerns tied to underwater bonds, with the notable exception of Bank of America . The bank piled into low-yielding securities during the pandemic and had more than $100 billion in paper losses on bonds at midyear. The issue constrains the bank's interest revenue and has made the lender the worst stock performer this year among the top six U.S. institutions. Expectations on the impact of higher rates on banks' balance sheets varied. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Betsy Graseck said in an October 2 note that the \"estimated impact from the bond rout in 3Q is more than double\" losses in the second quarter.\n\nHardest-hit banks\n\nBond losses will have the deepest impact on regional lenders including Comerica , Fifth Third Bank and KeyBank , the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Still, others including KBW and UBS analysts said that other factors could soften the capital hit from higher rates for most of the industry. \"A lot will depend on the duration of their books,\" Konrad said in an interview, referring to whether banks owned shorter or longer-term bonds. \"I think the bond marks will look similar to last quarter, which is still a capital headwind, but that there'll be a smaller group of banks that are hit more because of what they own.\" There's also concern that higher interest rates will result in ballooning losses in commercial real estate and industrial loans. \"We expect loan loss provisions to increase materially compared to the third quarter of 2022 as we expect banks to build up loan loss reserves,\" RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote in a Oct. 2 note.\n\nSilver linings"}, {"title": "Finance leaders stumble on Israel-Gaza war shock as IMF, World ... - Reuters", "date": "Mon, 16 Oct 2023 21:24:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "MARRAKECH, Morocco, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Global finance leaders' paralysis in coming to grips with the fallout from the Hamas attack and Israel's response last week exposed deep geopolitical divisions hampering the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, even as they advanced new funding plans aimed at easing more-frequent economic shocks.\n\nHamas launched its unprecedented attack on Israel on Oct. 7, just as top finance officials arrived in Morocco for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, upending the gathering's carefully crafted script calling for new resources and steps to revive flagging global growth.\n\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva did not mention the new conflict at opening events. Later, as Israel's retaliatory strikes mounted, she struggled to address it, describing it as a human tragedy but a vague source of economic uncertainty.\n\nIn private conversations at the meetings, the Israel-Gaza conflict's implications were front and center, from a new refugee crisis to trade impacts and the threat of fighting in Lebanon and the West Bank, participants from finance groups to non-profits told Reuters.\n\n\"In the face of a major global shock like this that\u2019s human created, that's not a climate shock, these institutions are impotent to do anything about it, which is why they\u2019re not even talking about it,\" said Rachel Nadelman, a senior research fellow at American University\u2019s Accountability Research Center, who attended civil society and official events at the meetings.\n\nThe inability to respond extended to chair's statements issued by the IMF and World Bank steering committees, once again unable to issue joint communiques amid deepening geopolitical tensions, most recently over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but also disputes between the United States and China.\n\nThe Group of 20 major economies did reach consensus on an official communique but omitted any mention of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nA G20 official said that body has been riven for two years by the Ukraine war, with a communique only possible after a meeting of U.S. President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping.\n\n\"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is even more controversial - almost impossible to reach consensus,\" the official said.\n\nA senior U.S. Treasury official said the human tragedy was in the foreground at the moment, not the economic consequences, and Russia's war remained the primary driver of geopolitical instability in the global arena. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy,\" the official said.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS OVERSHADOWED\n\nWorld Bank President Ajay Banga acknowledged on Sunday that the Israel-Gaza conflict, along with the Ukraine war and fighting in Africa, were \"casting long shadows\" over the meeting's accomplishments and adding to economic challenges.\n\n\"Without peace, it's hard for people to get stability, growth, look after their children, get jobs,\" he said.\n\nSenior World Bank Group officials were more pointed in a statement to staff, saying they were \"shocked and appalled by the unprecedented escalation of violence in Israel and Gaza.\"\n\n\"We condemn terrorism in all forms, including the abhorrent targeting of innocent civilians and kidnapping,\" the leaders of the World Bank, the International Finance Corp and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, said in an internal statement seen by Reuters.\n\nThe World Bank's governing body approved a new vision statement \"to create a world free of poverty on a livable planet\" to incorporate its new mission to fight climate change, pandemics and fragile states, along with new steps to expand lending.\n\nThe IMF's steering committee agreed to boost quota funding by year-end, leaving the door open to doing so without adjusting its shareholding structure to give China more votes, while a $3 billion fundraising goal for its poor-country trust fund was met.\n\nBut conflicts remain the biggest challenge to the global economy, said Josh Lipsky, a former IMF official who directs the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center.\n\n\"If these institutions are going to be legitimate and fit-for-purpose for the coming decade, they're going to have to respond to geopolitical crises in close to real time,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"Geopolitical shocks are economic shocks now and economic shocks are geopolitical shocks - and they're trying to detach the two.\"\n\nReporting by Andrea Shalal and David Lawder; Editing by Giles Elgood and Stephen Coates\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "JPMorgan profit beats estimates on record interest income, First ... - Reuters", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 16:02:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "JPMorgan Chase Bank is seen in New York City, U.S., March 21, 2023. REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nOct 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) beat expectations for third-quarter profit on Friday as rising borrowing costs and its acquisition of failed First Republic Bank drove income from interest payments to a record high.\n\nJPMorgan took on billions of dollars in consumer loans after it rescued First Republic in May, bolstering its net interest income (NII), or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays out on deposits.\n\nWhile U.S. consumers remain healthy, CEO Jamie Dimon warned geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine and conflict in Israel could keep inflation at elevated levels.\n\n\"This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,\" said Dimon, who leads the biggest U.S. lender.\n\nNII rose 30% to $22.9 billion, the bank said. Excluding the impact of First Republic, it still rose 21%. JPMorgan also raised its NII forecast for this year to $89 billion, boosting it $2 billion from an earlier estimate.\n\nShares rose more than 3%.\n\nChief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum cautioned that the current NII levels were not sustainable and could moderate to around $80 billion.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady, but has indicated it could keep borrowing costs higher for a prolonged period.\n\nThe results \"look really good and it just shows what a great operator they are,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago, who owns JPMorgan shares. \"This just showed what a really well run bank can do in a tough environment,\" Kuby said.\n\nThe bank released $113 million in net reserves in the third quarter on back of an improved economic outlook. Modest growth over the next few quarters has replaced the recessionary outlook forecasted earlier, Barnum said.\n\nINVESTMENT BANKING LULL\n\nWhile the market for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and initial public offerings (IPOs) is showing signs of a recovery, lingering economic uncertainty continues to be a drag on dealmaking activity.\n\nSeptember saw stock market debuts of several high-profile companies, including SoftBank Group's (9984.T) chip designer Arm Holdings and grocery delivery app Instacart (CART.O). JPMorgan was an underwriter for both of those listings.\n\nBut these newly listed companies have given back most of their gains after their first-day pop, crushing hopes of a meaningful recovery in the IPO market.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at JPMorgan fell 6% to $1.6 billion. The outlook for investment banking is slightly more optimistic than last quarter, Barnum said, despite hurdles in mergers and acquisitions.\n\nJPMorgan has so far managed to avoid mass layoffs in contrast with some of its Wall Street rivals that have laid off thousands of employees. The bank's workforce grew almost 3%, or 8,603 employees, to 308,669 at the end of the third quarter as it added First Republic employees.\n\nBut the company could adjust its headcount depending on the investment banking environment, Barnum said.\n\nThe bank has reorganized the leadership in its investment bank, promoting a new head in North America to succeed Fernando Rivas, who plans to retire, Reuters reported last month.\n\nThe bank's consumer business remains a key area of growth, with more demand for car lending and credit cards, but that could slow down, Barnum said.\n\nThe bank also booked nearly $700 million in legal expenses. Last month, JPMorgan agreed to pay $75 million to settle claims by the U.S. Virgin Islands that it aided in the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking.\n\nAs part of another settlement in June, it had also agreed to pay about $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit by Epstein's victims. JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing in either case. The settlements largely resolved a scandal that has weighed on JPMorgan all year.\n\nThe lender's profit rose 35% to $13.15 billion, or $4.33 per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30.\n\nExcluding one-time costs, the bank reported a profit of $4.50 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $3.96 per share, according to LSEG IBES data.\n\nJPMorgan also set aside $1.4 billion for potential losses on souring loans.\n\n\"The first half of this year has seen JPMorgan set itself apart from the rest of the U.S. banking sector,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market Analyst at CMC Markets UK.\n\nRivals Citigroup(C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) also reported third-quarter profit above expectations.\n\nBASEL III ENDGAME\n\nExecutives reiterated their strong opposition to draft rules that would raise capital requirements for large lenders.\n\nJPMorgan may need to exit certain businesses if the proposals are implemented because it could be forced to set aside 25% more capital, or $50 billion, Barnum said.\n\nDimon has previously blasted stricter capital rules proposed by U.S. regulators. The draft regulations could prompt lenders to pull back and stymie economic growth, he told investors last month.\n\nThe moves to require banks to set aside more capital were \"hugely disappointing,\" he said.\n\nReporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru and Nupur Anand in New York, additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Lananh Nguyen, Anil D'Silva and Nick Zieminski\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "Israel, the West Bank and Gaza: Travel Advisory Remains - United ... - Department of State", "date": "Sat, 14 Oct 2023 12:34:47 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.state.gov", "title": "Department of State"}, "text": "The Department of State updated its Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza on October 14, 2023, to reflect the authorized departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and eligible family members for U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Branch Office Tel Aviv.

More than 1,700 Palestinians at least 1,300 Israelis have been killed.\n\nOn Friday, Israel called for all civilians in the northern half of Gaza, more than 1 million people, to relocate south within 24 hours as it amassed tanks for an expected ground assault. The United Nations warned this could not happen \"without devastating humanitarian consequences\".\n\nIn a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jordan on Friday, Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority (PA), said that the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would constitute a repeat of 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from what is now Israel. Most Gazans are the descendants of such refugees.\n\nThe escalation in Gaza has worsened violence that had already been surging for months in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank, where Israeli troops have killed at least 43 Palestinians during clashes since Saturday, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nIn Hebron, thousands of men and women took to the streets, waving the flags of both Hamas and Fatah. They carried signs that read \"Stop the Gaza genocide\" and \"U.S. capitalism is addicted to war.\"\n\nIn the northern city of Nablus, youths clashed with the Israeli military, flipping cars and setting tyres and garbage cans on fire to block roads. By Friday afternoon, Palestinian fighters were still engaged in gunfights with Israeli soldiers in different areas of the Palestinian territory, where the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule.\n\nThe Israeli military has said it is prepared for an escalation in the West Bank and its forces have been on high alert, carrying out arrests and thwarting possible attacks.\n\nThe Palestinian Prisoners Association said Israel arrested at least 60 people in the West Bank on Friday, among them Hamas leaders.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority wants an independent state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, areas Israel captured in a 1967 Middle East war. That prospect seems as far away as ever amid expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, cutting communities from each other, and a freeze in U.S.-sponsored negotiations.\n\nAbbas has condemned violence against civilians and said the PA would pursue political action to achieve its goals.

REUTERS/Ann Saphir/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said Wednesday while the odds of the economy escaping a recession have grown, it\u2019s possible the central bank is not done with interest rate hikes aimed at bringing inflation back to its target.\n\n\u201cI expect we\u2019ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time \u2013 until we see evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2%,\u201d Collins said in a speech text. \u201cAnd while we are likely near, and could be at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted depending on incoming information,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the Fed having raised rates from near zero levels in the spring of 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.5% range, Collins, who does not have a vote on the rate setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, said now is a time for the Fed to take its time to decide what its next move will be.\n\n\u201cPatience will give us time to better separate \u2018signal\u2019 from \u2018noise\u2019 in the data and to balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to work through the economy,\u201d Collins said. That the Fed has shifted to this stance reflects the need to balance out risks of inflation remaining too high against slowing the economy too much, the official said.\n\nCollins\u2019 remarks came after the release of meeting minutes from the Fed\u2019s September gathering. Then, officials held rates steady but kept the option alive of raising them again even as inflation pressures have been cooling. In recent comments, a slew of officials have cited rising bond market yields, which should create restraint on the economy, as a factor that may allow them to call it a day on their rate hike cycle.\n\nIn her speech, Collins said it appears the savings levels are starting to dry up and because of that the economy is likely to become more responsive to changes in monetary policy, suggesting Fed policy is likely to weigh on the data more than it has.\n\nCollins said the economy has been surprisingly resilient in the face of Fed action and she believes the path to achieving a soft landing has grown.\n\n\u201cI continue to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and only a modest increase in the unemployment rate,\u201d Collins said.\n\nReporting by Michael S.

The road to Marrakech was not an easy one, delayed by the pandemic and persevering after an earthquake. Yet the warmth and hospitality we\u2019ve received from your government and all Moroccans has been humbling.\n\nKristalina \u2013 it is a privilege to host these Annual Meetings together.\n\nI would like to thank my predecessor, David.\n\nThose of us in this room are fortunate. We are custodians of an institution with a tremendous responsibility at a time of uncertainty and great consequence.\n\nThe world is fraught with profound forces and rapid changes.\n\nWe face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, food insecurity, fragility, a fledgling pandemic recovery, and are feeling the effects of conflicts beyond the front.\n\nA perfect storm of intertwined challenges and geopolitical complexity that taken together exacerbate inequality.\n\nEconomic growth in much of the developing world is retreating. Falling from 6 percent to 5 percent in two decades, and on track for just 4 percent over the next 7 years.\n\nWith each lost percent, 100 million people are pulled into poverty and another 50 million people are pushed into extreme poverty.\n\nDig deeper and you\u2019ll find people struggling to provide for themselves and their families as incomes have stagnated. In Sub-Saharan Africa per capita income is the same as it was 14 years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, debt has increased throughout emerging markets \u2013 doubling in Africa \u2013 shackling countries to the ground just as they\u2019re trying to rise.\n\nWe are living in a world with alarming challenges but at a time of intensifying polarization and extremes.\n\nBeneath the surface, a growing mistrust is pulling the Global North and South apart, complicating the prospect of progress.\n\nThe Global South\u2019s frustration is understandable. In many ways they are paying the price for the prosperity of others.\n\nWhen they should be ascendant, they\u2019re concerned promised resources will never manifest, they feel energy rules aren\u2019t applied universally, and they\u2019re worried a burgeoning generation will be locked into a prison of poverty.\n\nBut the truth is: We cannot endure another period of emission heavy growth.\n\nWe must find a way to finance a different world where our climate is protected, pandemics are manageable \u2013 if not preventable \u2013 food is abundant, and fragility and poverty are defeated.\n\nOur task is great.\n\nLooking across the world it is easy to be consumed by a sense of despair.\n\nYet \u2013 in all corners of the globe, people are eager to go to work, and to create with their own hands. They want a better life for their children and grandchildren.\n\nI have felt that yearning among entrepreneurs in Nigeria, seen it in the proud eyes of artists in Indonesia, and touched it on the worn hands of farmers in Jamaica.\n\nThe Bank has an obligation \u2013 a duty \u2013 to match their energy with a fierce determination. We must be the hand on the back \u2013 moving people forward. We must be an institution that exports optimism and impact.\n\nBut we must change to make good on that promise and deliver on what is being demanded.\n\nThe World Bank is turning to face the wind.\n\nThat evolution began months ago, and today there is a new vision and mission for the World Bank.\n\nTo create a world free of poverty \u2013 on a livable planet.\n\nBut time is of the essence.\n\nThis urgency motivated us to write a new playbook \u2013 a new mission. One that will drive impactful development and lead to a better quality of life \u2013 access to clean air, clean water, education and decent health care.\n\nIt is a mission that is inclusive of everyone, including women and young people;\n\nResilient to shocks, including against climate and biodiversity crises, pandemics and fragility;\n\nAnd sustainable, through growth and job creation, human development, fiscal and debt management, food security and access to clean air, water, and affordable energy.\n\nWith this vision, we are widening the aperture of the World Bank, reflecting a reality that the luxury of choice was for the last generation.\n\nTo confront the intertwined challenges, our only option is to respond aggressively, simultaneously, and comprehensively.\n\nWe cannot make adequate progress on public health while rising temperatures change the patterns of infectious diseases and breed pandemics.\n\nWe can\u2019t help farmers expand crop yields and feed growing populations using techniques that were not designed for years long droughts.\n\nAnd we will never reliably connect entrepreneurs with markets if the roads they rely on for shipping get washed away every year in a flood.\n\nThis is why we need a new playbook.\n\nAt the center must be women and young people.\n\nWithout a focus on both we are fighting with a hand behind our back.\n\nGlobally, women have not seen their participation in the labor force improve since 1990. And when they do get a seat at the table they aren\u2019t paid equally.\n\nWe cannot defeat poverty with half the world\u2019s population on the sideline.\n\nAnd young people, they can be the engine of our future; but only if we provide quality of life when they\u2019re growing up \u2013 and then a job.\n\nWith a job comes dignity, pride, the ability to provide for yourself and your family.\n\nWithout a job \u2013 or the hope of one \u2013 human despair turns to anger, in those moments people grasp for any hand that offers a way out. Those costs can deliver irreparable harm on a society \u2013 or \u2013 on entire generations.\n\nThe urgency and importance cannot be overstated. Our own estimates project that in the next 10 years, 1.1 billion young people across the Global South will become working age adults. Yet, in the same period and same countries, we are only expected to create 325 million jobs.\n\nThe cost of inaction is unimaginable \u2013 this demographic dividend must not be allowed to become a demographic challenge.\n\nThis vision and mission will test the sincerity of our ambition \u2013 it sets us on a journey that will require reimagined partnerships, a new way of working and thinking, an innovative plan to scale and replicate, additional resources, and optimism for what could be possible.\n\nThat is the new direction of the World Bank and what I am excited to share with you today.\n\nWe took our first steps on this journey in April, squeezing $40 billion over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan to equity ratio.\n\nAnd over the last few months, we dug even deeper, creating a portfolio guarantee mechanism and launching a hybrid capital instrument.\n\nThese new tools enable us to take more risks and boost our lending capacity further \u2013 all while preserving our AAA rating. Taken together we could provide $157 billion more in lending capacity over a decade.\n\nOur work has been met with enthusiasm \u2013 and generosity.\n\nGermany moved first to support hybrid capital, their contribution will give us \u20ac2.4 billion in additional IBRD lending over the next 10 years.\n\nWhile the United States\u2019 early support for portfolio guarantees could unlock roughly $25 billion in new IBRD lending \u2013 and we expect others to join in soon.\n\nWhat makes these tools unique \u2013 and a good investment \u2013 is their ability to leverage every dollar six to eight times over 10 years.\n\nBut we are not stopping there.\n\nWith other multilateral development banks, we are exploring ways to better utilize callable capital and SDRs. Both are complicated but achievable. Unlocking their potential will take time and requires action from shareholders and central banks.\n\nWe see other opportunities.\n\nOur Global Public Goods Fund was designed to incentivize cooperation across borders and tackle shared challenges. But, in the past, the funding came only from IBRD\u2019s income, holding back its potential.\n\nNow, we\u2019re opening the door to governments and philanthropies, which could grow concessional resources. With this bigger ambition and ability to deliver on our new mission we believe this will be a true Livable Planet Fund.\n\nWe know this model can work. In a big step forward, Uruguay became the first country to take advantage of reduced interest rates as a direct result of meeting climate performance targets.\n\nAn innovative approach that we aim to scale.\n\nAnd we are continuing to test other ideas across our ecosystem of incentives.\n\nWe\u2019re exploring maturities of 35 to 40 years to help countries navigate longer term horizons for social and human capital investments.\n\nWe\u2019re investigating if we can reduce interest rates to incentivize exiting from coal as part of energy transitions.\n\nAnd in countries that utilize both IDA and IBRD, we\u2019re looking to find ways to encourage a renewable energy transition by increasing concessional finance in the mix.\n\nThis spirit of innovation and exploration is comprehensive.\n\nThe World Bank stepped forward to support the most vulnerable when compounding challenges \u2013 the War in Ukraine, effects of the pandemic, and inflation \u2013 hit. But the need was so great that we allocated the majority of our three-year Crisis Response Window in the first year.\n\nSo now, we need to replenish it.\n\nOur objective is to raise $4 billion for the Crisis Response Window Plus.\n\nThe United States is requesting $1 billion from Congress. And other countries \u2013 like the Nordics \u2013 are pledging donations.\n\nStill, we are a long way from our goal and time is short.\n\nWe are looking for others to step forward. We need our donors\u2019 help to reload this fund and carry us through our next IDA cycle.\n\nIf we really want to incentivize change \u2013 we can\u2019t just wish it \u2013 we need to fight for it.\n\nNowhere is this truer than IDA. We are pushing the limits of this important concessional resource and no amount of creative financial engineering will compensate for the fact that we need more funding.\n\nThis must drive each of us to make the next replenishment of IDA the largest of all time.\n\nWe need donors, shareholders, and philanthropies to step up, join us, and bring their ambition to this fight, otherwise these instruments are just theoretical.\n\nMeanwhile, we aren\u2019t waiting.\n\nWe are recruiting new partners and reimagining partnerships.\n\nWe are joining with others, working alongside multilateral development banks to coordinate global action, catalyze change, and multiply impact.\n\nDuring my first trip, Ilan Goldfajn from the InterAmerican Development Bank and I visited Peru and Jamaica to make purposeful what too often has been accidental \u2013 collaboration.\n\nOur partnership focuses on three objectives: attack deforestation the Amazon, strengthen the Caribbean\u2019s resilience to natural disasters, and bridge the digital-access gap across Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nWe will not deliver results overnight but together our impact will be greater than it would be on our own. That is why the World Bank is reaching out to other institutions in hopes of establishing similar partnerships.\n\nThat spirit of common cause is shared among multilateral development banks.\n\nWe are oriented toward impact and the competition of the past has begun to give way. We recognize there is much we can do together, but in these early days we are focusing our energy on four areas that will lift us all.\n\nOne, we are working with credit rating agencies to help improve their understanding of our work and risks. They are integral to unlocking capital and pricing. Without progress, ideas like callable capital will be out of reach.\n\nTwo, we are expanding collaboration on joint financing. Establishing a Co-Financing Platform to facilitate coordination across global and regional priorities.\n\nThree, we are standardizing our processes, reducing transaction costs, and freeing up technical capacity. Already we are making progress on procurement and streamlining environmental and social frameworks.\n\nAnd finally, we are developing a new approach to track climate outcomes based on impact. We plan to share more about our progress at COP28 in Dubai.\n\nThis unified approach could greatly benefit the governments we serve, making it easier for them to access resources from a diverse set of multilateral development banks, focusing lending through a single country platform.\n\nBut the World Bank \u2013 and my friends in the other multilateral development banks \u2013 don\u2019t have a monopoly on good ideas.\n\nWe should steal shamelessly \u2013 and share seamlessly.\n\nAnd we must do it with \u2013 and among \u2013 think tanks, the private sector, civil society, and \u2013 anyone who is moving the needle.\n\nThere is much we can do together but this commitment to impact begins with ourselves.\n\nThe World Bank has launched an ambitious program to quicken our pace, increase our efficiency, and simplify our processes.\n\nKnowing that when development is delayed \u2013 development is denied.\n\nBy the numbers, one year without education reduces a person\u2019s future income by 10 percent annually.\n\nDepriving a child of proper nutrition in their first 1,000 days, decreases their income by around 17 percent every year \u2013 for the rest of their life.\n\nYet, at the World Bank, we are spending the same amount of time on a difficult project, like a 2,000-mile transmission line that traverses conflict zones and critical environments, as we do constructing a small solar grid or new school.\n\nOur teams spend months preparing reports that evaluate risk from every angle \u2013 4,880 days of staff time each year just on duplicative internal reviews and clearances.\n\nAnd when a project works that should be expanded, our processes require teams to start fresh \u2013 telling communities to wait patiently while children grow, poverty deepens, untreated illnesses worsen, and the worn path to clean water is packed harder step, by step, by step.\n\nCurrently, a World Bank project takes 27 months \u2013 on average \u2013 before a single dollar gets out the door. This is followed by a lengthy implementation process and project construction.\n\nToo often it\u2019s longer than 10 years before the first benefits are felt.\n\nThat is a lifetime.\n\nWe must do better. And there is precious time we can save.\n\nWe have the entire process in our crosshairs, initially working to dramatically reduce the project review and approval time by one-third.\n\nBut with ambition to do more.\n\nOur plan calls for simplifying approvals, proportionately adjusting reviews, and combining intelligent technology with shorter timelines to drive speed.\n\nAnd we will do it without making a single change to our environmental and social standards that protect the communities we work for and give peace of mind to our partners and shareholders.\n\nWe do not believe quality conflicts with speed; we believe we can deliver both quality and speed.\n\nThis is important progress but there\u2019s more we can do and are developing a plan to better support governments with implementation. If we can build technical assistance into our projects from the start and help countries develop capacity \u2013 we can give time back.\n\nNot only are we streamlining our approach and encouraging our teams to work faster \u2013 we are exploring ways to incentivize speed and collaboration throughout the World Bank.\n\nThat need for collaboration, demand for impact, and belief that there is elegance in simplicity has inspired us to think about a potentially transformational program.\n\nOur hope is to refocus the World Bank to confront challenges not just as a funding mechanism, but as a knowledge mechanism.\n\nThat\u2019s what governments are calling for \u2013 our knowledge.\n\nThe World Bank has long been celebrated for approaching the thorniest problems to find solutions and change lives.\n\nIn my brief time at the Bank, I have seen that impact with my own eyes.\n\nIn India, technology is used to track student attendance and performance in real time. Education experts spot problems, take quick action, and get kids back on track.\n\nAs a result, student and teacher attendance, and enrollment have all increased.\n\nIn Peru, free legal centers are changing \u2013 and saving \u2013 lives. Every day there are lines out the door.\n\nWomen pursuing unpaid pensions and child support, others seeking justice for domestic and sexual violence.\n\nStories that aren\u2019t unique to women in Peru.\n\nIt\u2019s not just India and Peru that are trying to improve education outcomes or create more equitable societies. So, why haven\u2019t we exported this success?\n\nThe World Bank has enjoyed many successes. Knowledge gained with each.\n\nIn the last five years alone, we helped 100 million people find jobs, we expanded healthcare access to over 1 billion people, we\u2019ve helped nearly 500 million kids get an education, and we\u2019ve reduced carbon emissions by over 230 million tons annually.\n\nAnd despite this progress \u2013 too many still haven't felt the impact of what we have done.\n\nToo many are still unable to enjoy the dignity of work.\n\nToo many still live without access to electricity, quality education, decent health care.\n\nAnd too many of our most impactful projects go no further than a report on a shelf.\n\nTo reverse the trend and extend the hand of good fortune further, we must scale and replicate the impactful solutions we have worked so hard to find.\n\nAnd we will do this in way that makes the World Bank more approachable, accessible, and understandable.\n\nFirst, bringing our knowledge to the forefront of our country driven model \u2013 and Country Partnership Frameworks. Sitting as partners with governments, working to craft a focused development plan that is a marriage of their ambition and our expertise.\n\nSecond, helping to create and cultivate bankable projects and implement them. Our knowledge teams, working with our country teams to bring all the World Bank offers to bear \u2013 being a force multiplier for governments when additional capacity is needed.\n\nAnd finally, driving thought leadership that moves the Bank, the world, and big ideas forward through our research, reports, and broader engagement.\n\nOur knowledge work \u2013 the country partnership frameworks, cultivating bankable projects, and our thought leadership \u2013 will be organized into five simple verticals:\n\nPeople \u2013 health, education, social protection\n\nProsperity \u2013 jobs, tax policy, economic policy, financial inclusion, small business\n\nPlanet \u2013 air, water, soil health, biodiversity, forests, adaptation and mitigation\n\nInfrastructure \u2013 roads, bridges, energy\n\nDigital \u2013 because that\u2019s transforming our world and will make everything else possible.\n\nAnd across those five verticals \u2013 holding our feet to the fire \u2013 we will measure our impact on gender equality, jobs for young people, and climate impacts.\n\nEmbedded within the vault of the knowledge bank are our eight global challenges \u2013 Adaptation and Mitigation; Fragility and Conflict; Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness; Energy Access; Food and Nutrition Security; Water Security and Access; Enabling Digitalization; and Protecting Biodiversity and Nature.\n\nAll organized in a way that ensures impact at scale.\n\nBut even with a better Bank. Even with governments, multilateral institutions, and philanthropies all working together we will still fall short.\n\nWe need the scale, resources, and ingenuity of the private sector.\n\nThus far, IFC has worked with the private sector using just $5.6 billion of shareholder capital to mobilize $162 billion of private sector investments.\n\nBut truly meaningful, sustainable progress has evaded us.\n\nTo help solve this riddle, we launched the Private Sector Investment Lab and recruited fifteen of the world\u2019s leading CEOs \u2013 across asset management companies, banks, as well as operators.\n\nWe are exploring opportunities for the World Bank to help mitigate risk, drive policy actions to entice new entrants, and ensure projects become bankable.\n\nWe are trying to make systemic change.\n\nThe Lab is initially focused on increasing private investment in renewable energy and the energy transition in developing countries \u2013 searching for actionable ideas that will bend the curve on emissions heavy growth.\n\nThere are already signs of hope.\n\nIn the first meeting, we identified a set of markets, each with potential for private capital investments, but each with challenges that we must address.\n\nWe identified early ideas for how the Bank can better mobilize private finance.\n\nAmong those was to unify guarantee issuance across the institution, simplifying access to them and supporting an ambitious growth plan for MIGA over the next few years.\n\nSeeing the strong demand for this effective tool, we are already acting and exploring ways to deliver.\n\nWe are asking a lot of the private sector.\n\nWe are asking them to operate in places and in situations that their algorithms and expertise may not extend, on roads the World Bank has traveled for years.\n\nAnd if we are asking others to follow \u2013 we should be willing to share our map.\n\nThat means giving private sector investors and rating agencies usable data from our Global Emerging Markets Risk Database, originally developed to inform our own investing.\n\nWe believe transparency will inspire confidence and will lead to more informed decision making, risk taking, and ultimately investing in emerging markets.\n\nOur plan is to release this data in a matter of months.\n\nWe are working now, in concert with other multilateral development banks, to reconstruct and clean the database to ensure its quality. This is a first step; we are continuing to explore what more we can do with our data to mobilize private capital.\n\nBut our devotion is not just reflected in our words, it should be measured in action.\n\nWe are becoming more efficient \u2013 incentivizing output, not input, and ensuring we focus less on money out the door and more on how many girls are in school, how many jobs are created, how many tons of carbon dioxide emissions are avoided, and how many private sector dollars are mobilized.\n\nThat is why we are reconstructing our corporate scorecard from the ground up. Pointing it toward outcomes and evidence \u2013 bringing it down from 153 items to around 20.\n\nThis scorecard will be our yardstick of accountability and a guidepost that our teams can rally around and work toward.\n\nBut by any measure, the World Bank is better today than it was yesterday.\n\nWe have a new vision and mission, we are asking all we can from our balance sheet, we are unleashing the potential of our Livable Planet Fund, and giving IDA the attention it deserves.\n\nWe are becoming faster and more efficient; we have new ways to respond to crises, we are focusing our knowledge bank on scale, and driving thought leadership.\n\nWe are collaborating with partners to maximize impact, and we are working side-by-side with the private sector.\n\nAnd though we are making a difference, though we are evolving, though we are operating with urgency \u2013 our work has just begun.\n\nThe ambition of the Evolution Roadmap should not be the end of our ambition for the World Bank.\n\nThough we don\u2019t have all the answers now, and those we are working toward will take time, we do have desire, energy, and focus.\n\nThere are new frontiers to explore \u2013 like moving from small, bespoke loans to large, standardized investments that can be packaged.\n\nIf done right, we could draw in institutional investors \u2013 pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds \u2013 and put their $70 trillion to work in developing countries.\n\nThis has been the thing of fantasy for years, but hope isn\u2019t a strategy.\n\nWe are in early days of building such a platform. But by doing the hard work now, we will be in a position later for success.\n\nSuccess that could be further multiplied across multilateral development banks to mobilize much greater amounts of private capital than ever before.\n\nBut let us not forget, we aren\u2019t starting at square one.\n\nEvery day, millions of people do their best to be part of the solution. There are real examples of action.\n\nIn Nigeria, shopkeepers are using solar power to keep their shops open late into the evening.\n\nIn Indonesia, mangrove rehabilitation efforts are reducing carbon emissions, creating sustainable employment for women, and protecting communities from floods.\n\nIn Vietnam, rice farmers are embracing new techniques that slash methane emissions, while increasing incomes.\n\nWe do not suffer from a shortage of solutions; we are paralyzed by a persistent lack of courage to pursue them.\n\nThe good news is that we have solutions like these within reach, and resources at our disposal to scale them.\n\nFor example, we can spend better.\n\nEvery year $1.25 trillion are spent on subsidies for fossil fuels, agriculture, and fisheries. Some of these are very important and needed, but in other cases we can do better.\n\nThe economic costs of fertilizer runoff, unnecessary air pollution, and overfishing is $6 trillion \u2013 every \u2013 single \u2013 year.\n\nBy repurposing some of this money to incentivize sustainable practices \u2013 we can protect, air, water, and forests \u2013 while continuing to support those most in need.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this work.\n\nEurope worked for years to repurpose subsidies that once encouraged excessive fertilizer use. Now, the same amount of money goes to the same farmer to reduce fertilizer use \u2013 leading to a climate positive impact.\n\nBut not all solutions are years away.\n\nWe are in the final stages of a 20-year effort to build sound, transparent voluntary carbon markets.\n\nThis effort learns from the past to protect against greenwashing and ensure the integrity of emission reduction credits.\n\nThis assurance is a crucial piece of a complex puzzle.\n\nValidation is the backbone of healthy markets, it feeds investor confidence and generates better prices \u2013 enabling countries blessed with natural resources to see the value of monetizing these assets and protecting them.\n\nMost importantly, they generate income for families and communities.\n\nIf successful, voluntary carbon markets could become more liquid, transparent and a better deal for developing countries.\n\nOur ambition is to grow this platform to finance emissions reductions in developing countries and benefit local communities.\n\nOur aspirations are limitless.\n\nDriving our work to deliver a better bank because eventually we will need a bigger bank. That will be the acid test of ambition.\n\nNearly all estimates make clear adequate progress requires trillions annually; far more than what the capital adequacy framework will produce by itself. The private sector can help.\n\nBut we will need a bigger bank to increase our financing capacity, take on more risk to encourage investment, and support the replicability and scalability that the World Bank is preparing to deliver.\n\nThe World Bank is merely an instrument that reflects the ambition of our shareholders, the progress we aspire to achieve requires our resources and capital to be commensurate with our vision and the demands upon us.\n\nBut if there is wisdom in our origins, it is that we can do big things together.\n\nEvery generation believes that the set of challenges laid before them are the most difficult, consequential, and intractable.\n\nBut never has humanity stared down a set of problems so complex and severe \u2013 that our very existence is in question.\n\nHowever, as the leader of an institution founded on the principles of peace and cooperation, I wanted the first time I spoke with you to be with a message of impact and optimism.\n\nThere is nothing that gives me more hope than our capacity to work together in common purpose.\n\nBut too often we look to the ground and fail to lift our gaze.\n\nBut if one thing is clear today, it should be that the eyes of the World Bank are fixed on the horizon.\n\nWe have inherited decades of knowledge and benefitted from the generosity of every nation, now we are being called upon to lead, and we have never been better positioned to deliver the progress that is demanded.\n\nOur financing is an attractive resource but not more than the World Bank\u2019s devotion, creativity, people, and innovation.\n\nThose are the attributes that will carry us forward on this journey.\n\nThank you."}, {"title": "India's HDFC Bank sees margins drop, bad loans rise post $40 bln ... - Reuters India", "date": "Mon, 16 Oct 2023 12:43:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters India"}, "text": "The headquarters of India's HDFC bank is pictured in Mumbai, India, December 4, 2015.

In the two top layers of leadership, 15% of functional roles were reduced, and the company has eliminated 60 committees, it said in a presentation.\n\n\"We need to change how we run Citi in order to truly transform it once and for all,\" CEO Jane Fraser told analysts on a conference call. \"These are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization.\"\n\nThe bank is eliminating co-heads of divisions and regional roles.

Still, the bank predicts a mild recession in the first half of next year.\n\nThe third-largest U.S. lender set aside more money to cover souring loans, but said delinquency levels were still low compared to historical levels. Citi's total provision for the credit portfolio rose to $17.6 billion from $16.3 billion a year earlier.\n\nU.S. banking giants have benefited from the Federal Reserve's campaign to quell inflation, which has increased borrowing costs and helped banks earn more from customer interest payments.\n\nEPS BEAT, HIGHER GUIDANCE\n\nCiti increased its forecast for net interest income (NII) this year to more than $47.5 billion from $46 billion, excluding markets. It also plans a modest level of stock buybacks in the fourth quarter, Mason said.\n\nThe quarter was much better than anticipated because of interest income and expenses, wrote Piper Sandler analyst Scott Siefers in a note to clients.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts also saw the results as positive.\n\n\"The market will ... see the change in NII revenue guidance as constructive as it implies an improved revenue mix against a more uncertain macro-economic backdrop.\"\n\nThe bank's shares climbed more than 1% gaining more than 3% earlier Friday.\n\nCiti's net income rose 2% to $3.5 billion versus a year earlier, while earnings per share remained stable at $1.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.52 per share to beat the LSEG estimate of $1.21.\n\nRevenue from the institutional clients group that houses its Wall Street operations rose 12% from a year ago, fueled by a 10% gain in trading revenues to $4.5 billion. Fixed income brought in 14% higher revenue.\n\nOverall revenue climbed 9% to $20.1 billion.\n\nInvestment banking fees jumped 34%. Recent initial public offerings and debt issuance were positive signals for the business, and there is a good pipeline of merger and acquisition discussions, Fraser said.

It included severance payments for employees who were laid off as it sold some international consumer businesses. Citi is close to concluding its divestitures in Asia.\n\nRivals Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) also reported higher quarterly profits on Friday, boosted by rising interest payments.

And some of them did steal 2.2 million rupees ($27,000) from 362 customers, internal audit reports and records of the bank have revealed.\n\nThe audits come after an expose by The Reporters\u2019 Collective (TRC) and Al Jazeera, which showed the bank\u2019s employees had linked unauthorised mobile numbers to customer accounts that were missing a registered mobile number to onboard them on the bank\u2019s new mobile banking app, bob World. These unauthorised mobile numbers were of bank staff, managers, guards, their relatives and bank agents in remote areas.\n\nThe story warned that the bank\u2019s underhand tactics, devised under pressure to boost registrations on its app, could lead to identity theft and pose a grave risk to the money of customers. The bank admitted as much in internal emails last year. \u201cIt is a fraud-prone area,\u201d multiple emails about the bogus mobile numbers noted.\n\nNow, internal documents of the bank\u2019s head office acknowledge this malpractice and show that the bank\u2019s agents, called business correspondents, have withdrawn tens of thousands of rupees from customers\u2019 accounts by using mobile banking. Six customers have lost upwards of 110,000 rupees ($1,330) each, whereas one lost almost 177,000 rupees ($2,140). One agent stole more than 390,000 rupees ($4,750).\n\nThe bank\u2019s head office has asked the managers concerned to \u201cinitiate necessary action for recovery and restoration of money in customer accounts\u201d.\n\nThe admission of fraud came after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country\u2019s central bank, ordered an audit following The Reporters\u2019 Collective-Al Jazeera investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the RBI said that it has directed the Bank of Baroda to stop registering new customers on bob World because of \u201ccertain material supervisory concerns observed in the manner of onboarding of their customers onto this mobile application\u201d.\n\nIn its nationwide audit, the Bank of Baroda verified documents of about 422,000 accounts that were suspected to be wrongfully registered on the app by the bank staff. The bank\u2019s branch staff audited these accounts spread over nearly 7,000 branches across the country on July 29 and 30, with each employee auditing documents of another branch.\n\nWhile final audit reports have duly pointed out discrepancies, indicating proper scrutiny at a higher level, these reports also establish the shoddy nature of the internal audit.\n\nMany bank employees told The Reporters\u2019 Collective (TRC) that this audit was not so much about detecting wrongdoing as about covering it up. They said that under instructions from their regional office, they arranged and forged documents for the audit.\n\nOne such employee, who himself procured documents from customers, said: \u201cThe bank knows it\u2019s in the wrong [with regard to bob World enrolment]. Now, it is in damage-control mode.\u201d\n\nExperts from the field of bank auditing and forensic accounting say the Bank of Baroda should not have deputed its branch staff for the audit in the first place. They say this task should have been outsourced for a fair investigation.\n\nThe bank asked its internal auditors to mainly look for bob World request letters that show customers requested the online app service on their phones, and forms that customers signed to change mobile numbers linked with their accounts. The presence of these forms is proof that bank staff did not perform the fraudulent workaround to flog the app.\n\nIn most of the cases, the documents were not found, audit reports accessed by TRC show.\n\nSerious gaps\n\nAudit reports of eight regions found bob World request letters for barely one-third of the bank accounts under investigation.\n\nThese reports note that in many accounts that were signed up on bob World, the registered mobile number belonged to the respective branch, to the branch manager or to \u201cbusiness correspondents\u201d \u2013 freelancers who operate as the bank\u2019s agents and provide banking services in rural and remote areas through customer service points.\n\nThe audit found that many accounts were linked with the mobile numbers of strangers. The bank has since instructed branches to immediately block mobile banking on such accounts.\n\nThe reports also found that in many accounts registered on bob World, unauthorised mobile numbers were linked and later removed from the back end. There are even instances wherein a customer provided one mobile number in the account-opening form but some other number was linked to his account and registered on bob World.\n\nFurther, while the bank\u2019s policy states that one mobile number can be linked with eight bank accounts at most \u2013 only if all accounts are of the same family \u2013 the audit reports flag many instances of violation of this policy.\n\nThey list many mobile numbers, mostly those of business correspondents, linked with 10\u201360 accounts. One region\u2019s report recommends that mobile numbers be unlinked from about one-fourth of the audited accounts.\n\nThe pan-India findings, too, seem to share these concerns. In a letter sent to all zonal and regional heads on August 10, Bank of Baroda\u2019s Chief General Manager B Elango wrote: \u201cThe results of the audit have revealed that there are gaps with respect to the availability of basic essential documents and we cannot allow to continue with the gaps that were noticed.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cLooking at [the] seriousness of these findings, we have initiated the process to get the irregularities rectified as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe letter said that branches must approach customers to obtain the missing documents, which have to be preserved after verification by higher offices.\n\nDamage control\n\nWhile the bank has acknowledged the case of unauthorised debits and missing documents, evidence and anecdotes shared by employees suggest that some regional offices prodded their junior staff to forge these documents in an effort to salvage the situation.\n\nOne of the cover-up tactics was to hurriedly add in the signatures and thumbprints of the bank customers on the mobile banking consent forms, many of which were arranged with a backdate \u2013 to enable the auditors to certify that all the documents were in place.\n\nEmployees from three states told TRC that at the branches they inspected or work at, these documents did not exist for many accounts and were fudged \u2013 in some cases, the signatures were forged and in others, the paperwork was done after the account had been registered on the app with branch staff going to account holders\u2019 residences with the papers to obtain signatures ahead of the auditing.\n\nTRC has seen copies of such documents created for a few account holders from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.\n\nFor instance, several documents from one branch in Uttar Pradesh had only the signatures of the account holder and no other details. The internal auditor who shared these forms with TRC said it was the branch staff that filled up the details, including the crucial ones such as the mobile number and the date of the application.\n\nThis auditor said his regional manager, in a video conference, had asked all the auditors to \u201ccooperate\u201d with the branch staff and strive to certify that all accounts are OK. Because of such instructions, the auditor said he approved even the forms he knew were freshly obtained.\n\nFrom another bank branch in Uttar Pradesh and one in Gujarat, TRC saw copies of audited forms with customers\u2019 thumbprints on them instead of signatures.\n\nBank employees who shared these forms said they do not know how these farmers, who cannot even sign their names, could use a mobile banking app. The employees said thumbprints were obtained on these forms just ahead of the auditing, and the branch staff filled in these forms.\n\nThe audit reports viewed by TRC also highlight that many illiterate customers were registered on bob World. Many of them were registered through a business correspondent\u2019s mobile number linked to their account.\n\nOne audit report flagged that illiterate customers are not eligible for the app. Similarly, children under the age of 15 are also not eligible, but many minors\u2019 accounts have been registered.\n\nMany of the accounts under scrutiny for app enrolment were opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. This scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to link the poor to the banking system by waiving minimum balance requirements and paying subsidies into their accounts.\n\nOne bank employee said he and his colleagues used pressure tactics to get these customers to sign the forms. He said the staff told customers they needed to sign the documents urgently to update account details, or else the accounts could get closed or the subsidy could stop. They were kept in the dark about bob World auditing.\n\nThis employee highlighted another anomaly. Auditors had been asked to verify account-opening forms, too, as these would have the customer\u2019s mobile number, but many accounts did not have those forms. So, along with the other documents, some branch staff obtained customers\u2019 signatures/thumbprints on these forms, too.\n\nSince employees of this branch did not want to risk inviting scrutiny by higher-ups on why they had been backdating these forms \u2013 even though those were their oral instructions \u2013 they either left the date blank or entered the date of the auditing on some of the freshly obtained forms.\n\nThus, these account-opening forms show the date of opening the account as July 29 or 30 (the dates of the auditing), even though these accounts have existed for at least a couple of years.\n\nThe audit reports seen by TRC show that this workaround was followed fairly commonly.\n\nThese reports not only highlight discrepancies, but also establish the shoddy nature of the internal audit. These reports are littered with remarks about customers\u2019 documents that are unfilled, partially filled, unsigned, undated, unverified or invalid for other reasons.\n\nIn a fair audit at the branch level, such documents would have been rejected, say experts.\n\nRed flags\n\nRegarded as a pioneer of forensic accounting in India, Certified Bank Forensic Accountant Mayur Joshi told TRC that in auditing, investigators ought to watch out for inconsistencies, such as a new, crisp form bearing an old date; or a new format of form bearing an old date.\n\nHe said there are auditing firms that specialise in the kind of document verification for which Bank of Baroda engaged its branch staff. He said the bank should have hired an external auditor for this case.\n\nCertified Fraud Examiner Nikhil Parulkar, who has two decades of experience in the banking and consulting industries, said the gravity of the allegations warranted an independent and impartial audit.\n\n\u201cHow can you ask a branch manager to conduct an audit when that\u2019s outside his scope of work? Is he a competent authority to conduct audits?\u201d he asked.\n\nIf customers\u2019 documents have indeed been procured and manipulated as described, it is an unhealthy and predatory practice, he added.\n\nJoshi said freshly obtained forms and backdated forms are perceived as red flags in the world of auditing. He said the very need to obtain basic documents anew is a serious issue since it indicates the bank did not have these documents, which violates the RBI\u2019s directions and can incur a penalty.\n\nThe number game\n\nOn July 25, two weeks after TRC and Al Jazeera published the expose, a regional office in the Bhopal zone sent to its branches an email bearing the subject line: \u201cURGENT REMINDER: Staff Mobile Number entered in Customers Accounts\u201d.\n\nThe opening line of the email reads: \u201cWe refer to the captioned subject and share the list of customer ids having mobile numbers of staff and Bank\u2019s CUG [Closed User Group] number seeded in customer\u2019s accounts and subsequently, bob World is activated using such mobile numbers.\u201d\n\nThe email asks these branches to investigate these cases and rectify the situation. The trail mail shows that this email originated at the bank\u2019s head office.\n\nOn August 1, Bank of Baroda\u2019s head office sent an email to the zonal head of Bhopal. The mail\u2019s opening line reads: \u201cAs instructed to us, we are sharing herewith the list of mobile numbers of Staff and Business Correspondents (BCs) which have been found to be linked with 316 & 1283 Customer IDs respectively in your Zone\u2026\u201d\n\nThe mail further says that the head office had earlier sent such a list of 313 and 4,118 Customer IDs.\n\nBank employees say that when customers approach business correspondents to open a bank account and do not have a mobile phone, business correspondents tend to enter their own mobile number as the customer\u2019s phone number.\n\nNow, branches have asked their agents to provide a list of bank accounts in which their mobile numbers ought to be retained, such as the accounts of their family members, and a list of accounts from which their numbers must be unlinked.\n\nThese emails and documents contradict the bank\u2019s response to the Al Jazeera story about bob World enrolment. At the time, the bank claimed: \u201cThe point raised on using unauthenticated, stranger\u2019s or non-customer mobile numbers boosting app registrations is not factually correct.\u201d\n\nFurther, Al Jazeera\u2019s previous story showed that last year, hundreds of mobile numbers were linked with dozens of accounts each in the bank\u2019s Bhopal zone itself. The bank\u2019s policy allows one number to be linked with no more than eight accounts, but a new set of internal emails further proves that this policy is not enforced.\n\nOn July 19, the bank\u2019s head office sent an email to all zonal and regional offices with a pan-India list of mobile numbers linked with more than eight customer IDs.\n\nAccording to this list, many mobile numbers stood linked with more than two dozen, three dozen and even four dozen accounts as of July. The number of such accounts stood at 225,001.\n\nThe head office had sent a similar email a day earlier as well, asking zonal and regional offices to \u201cprovide us the confirmation along with the proper justification for retention of same mobile number in more than 8 customer IDs. Subsequently, if same mobile number in more than 8 customer IDs is not required, kindly provide your recommendation for removal of the same from back end\u201d.\n\nRegional offices sent out this email to branches with lists of accounts from which unauthorised mobile numbers needed to be unlinked. TRC has reviewed copies of the emails.\n\nEmployees frustrated\n\nThe scandal at the Bank of Baroda has taken a toll on its employees. A number of them told TRC that they faced double jeopardy: First, the bank sets targets to register customers on bob World by any means possible, and now it puts pressure on them to produce documents showing customers asked for the service.\n\nThe bank employees involved in the cover-up during auditing said that while they might land in trouble in the future if the RBI picks up their forms for further scrutiny, they would certainly have landed in trouble had they disobeyed their regional manager and prepared a genuine audit report.\n\nSeveral employees gave first-hand accounts of how the pressure has affected them and the ethical shortcuts they and their colleagues were forced to adopt.\n\nThe head of a rural branch in Uttar Pradesh asked how consent forms would be available when mobile banking was activated under duress by adding someone else\u2019s mobile number to customers\u2019 accounts.\n\nAnother officer from the same state called this reporter agitated on the day of the auditing. He revealed that in his branch, the hapless staff were not only filling up customers\u2019 forms but also forging customers\u2019 signatures on them.\n\nBank of Baroda Employees\u2019 Union (Karnataka) has raised these concerns in its letter sent to the bank\u2019s managing director and CEO on July 30.\n\nIt states: \u201cWe are aghast with this internal audit since all these deviations have been carried out by the clerical staff on the oral instructions of the Branch Managers and with the knowledge of the Regional Authorities and now, the very same people are conducting the audit. It is possible that many records may be created or destroyed during this audit in order to shift the blame entirely on lower-level functionaries and particularly the clerical staff.\u201d\n\nThe letter adds that the union has long tried to draw the management\u2019s attention to issues about mobile banking and other irregularities, but to no avail.\n\n\u201cThe ones responsible for this mess, they should be held accountable,\u201d said a bank employee. \u201cDictatorship has been going on for a long time here.\u201d\n\nTRC asked the RBI in an email about its course of action, but did not receive a reply. TRC called Jesudas Pradeep G from RBI\u2019s Department of Supervision but he declined to comment, saying he is not authorised to speak with the media. Bank of Baroda, too, did not reply to TRC\u2019s questions about the internal audit and its findings.\n\nHemant Gairola is an associate member of The Reporters\u2019 Collective."}, {"title": "Nigeria central bank to intervene in forex market, lifts forex ban on ... - Reuters", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 19:15:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "ABUJA, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank said on Thursday it plans to intervene in the country's foreign exchange market occasionally to boost liquidity, while ending an eight-year ban on 43 items that had been restricted from accessing forex on the official market.\n\nThe ban, which covered items such as rice, cement and poultry, was imposed as part of the unorthodox policies under former central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele in an effort to prop up the naira currency.\n\nThe lifting of the ban will cheer analysts and investors who had been warning that the restriction showed the central bank was still maintaining some form of capital controls.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) also restated a pledge by new Governor Olayemi Cardoso last month to quickly clear the bank's backlog of unsettled forex obligations to local lenders, estimated at about $7 billion.\n\nAfrica's largest economy has struggled to get to grips with chronic dollar shortages on the official market, where trading volumes have steadily declined, causing the naira to slump to a record low against the dollar, with a 37% premium over the official exchange rate in street trading on Thursday.\n\n\"As part of its responsibility to ensure price stability, the CBN will boost liquidity in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market by interventions from time to time,\" central bank spokesperson Isa Abdulmumin said.\n\n\"As market liquidity improves, these CBN interventions will gradually decrease,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe naira has been weakening on the parallel market due to speculation and as excess demand is funnelled into the informal market, widening the gap with the official market, where restrictions on trading the currency were lifted in June.\n\nThe latest measures announced by the central bank are \"another market-friendly step\" to unify the exchange rates and ease pressure on the naira in the parallel market, where importers of the 43 items had to access dollars, said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy at U.K. based FIM Partners.\n\n\"There is still more to do.

Yellen on the ... - Treasury", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 21:31:56 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://home.treasury.gov", "title": "Treasury"}, "text": "The United States extends its deepest condolences to the people of Morocco and Libya, who have lost loved ones and now face the devastating impacts of once-in-a-century earthquake and floods. We stand by the governments of Morocco and Libya as they take steps to recover from the destruction these disasters have wrought.\n\nAs we gather for these Annual Meetings \u2013 for the first time in 50 years on the African continent \u2013 we are aware of two realities. On the one hand, the global economy remains in a better place than many predicted, with growth outperforming expectations, and annual headline inflation falling in many of the major economies, including the United States. At the same time, the global economy faces significant uncertainty. Major shocks emanating from global challenges\u2014the economic disruption from COVID-19; catastrophic, climate change-driven extreme weather events; and fragility and conflict in all parts of the world\u2014have eroded development gains and disproportionately impacted the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries. Russia\u2019s illegal and unjustifiable war of aggression against Ukraine has caused a tragic loss of life, destruction of property, and has exacerbated global economic challenges by destabilizing energy and food prices. We call on Russia to swiftly end this unjust war, which would help to rapidly reverse some of these trends and set the global economy on a more positive trajectory. The compounding effects of these shocks have taken a terrible toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods disrupted, and contributed to rising extreme poverty, hunger, and slower economic growth. Further, their impacts have been more severe across emerging markets and developing countries, often in those countries that are already burdened by heightened debt vulnerabilities and have the least fiscal space to respond.\n\nWe have undertaken important efforts over the last year to evolve the multilateral development banks (MDBs), starting with the World Bank, to better address global challenges, particularly climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. Addressing such challenges is in the national interest of all countries; mitigates risks to our collective economic outlook; and is integral to achieving poverty reduction and sustainable, inclusive, and resilient development.\n\nThe United States is not alone in this undertaking. Beginning with the Development Committee last year at the Annual Meetings, there has been a broad coalition calling for bold and urgent evolution reforms. In the G20, the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, the Africa Climate Summit, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit, the international community has also loudly and collectively voiced the importance of MDB evolution. Through these fora we have all recognized that addressing global challenges and achieving poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth are mutually reinforcing, and we must all work together to build an MDB system better equipped to respond.\n\nIn the past year, shareholders and World Bank Management have worked together to advance the reforms that will enable the Bank to evolve to bring 21st century solutions to 21st century challenges. We have updated the Bank\u2019s vision and mission to reflect that addressing global challenges is a core part of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The Bank\u2019s updated operational model will integrate global challenges through refocused diagnostics, enhanced country engagement, and greater support to sub-national entities. It will also deliver a concessionality framework that will enable greater support to address global challenges. Reforms to the IBRD financial model endorsed in the spring will yield around $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next 10 years, with more possible in the near term given the establishment of the Portfolio Guarantee Platform and work to issue hybrid capital to interested shareholders. This is just one part of the initial $200 billion in additional financial capacity we expect to achieve over the next decade across the MDB system through the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review recommendations that have been adopted or are under consideration. The energy behind the evolution work has sparked similar efforts at the regional development banks, which together with the World Bank, will make the entire system deliver better.\n\nThese accomplishments are significant. But our work is far from done. It is crucial that the World Bank robustly implement the evolution reforms that have been adopted, complete work on those currently underway\u2014like the concessionality framework and measures to increase speed and agility\u2014and begin work on reforms that have not yet been taken up. Specifically, we urge the World Bank to establish incentives for staff to incorporate addressing global challenges into country engagement, and fully implement the recommendations of the G20 MDB CAF Report, including the recommendation to incorporate a prudent share of callable capital in the Bank\u2019s capital adequacy framework. We also call on the World Bank to implement private capital mobilization (PCM) reforms that include incentives for staff to mobilize private capital rather than use own-account financing, ambitious portfolio-wide mobilization targets, clear reporting on results, and improved quality and accessibility of data in the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database. The World Bank \u2013 and other MDBs \u2013 should develop scalable platforms to increase private investment, including securitization platforms, and they should scale and better utilize guarantees, insurance, local currency lending, and other de-risking tools to crowd-in investors. We look forward to ideas from President Banga\u2019s new Private Sector Innovation Lab on how all parts of the World Bank can step up efforts in these areas.\n\nTaken together, these reforms across vision and mission; the operating model; and financial capacity will build a better bank that delivers both more finance and greater impact. And a strong and effective World Bank that is open and eager to partner with others is vital to having a strong and effective IFI system.\n\nIn support of the evolution agenda, President Biden requested funding from Congress to contribute to the new Portfolio Guarantee Platform and the Global Public Goods (GPG) Fund. This funding would unlock roughly $25 billion in new IBRD lending capacity, the terms of which could be bought down with the GPG Fund contribution to incentivize investments that address priority global challenges. Evolution will not succeed, however, without sufficient attention to the immediate needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries, that endure the harshest impact of global challenges and are least equipped to cope with them. This is why President Biden also requested $1 billion for IDA\u2019s Enhanced Crisis Response Window (CRW+). We appreciate those who have joined us in boosting the concessional finance capacity of the World Bank and invite others to do the same.\n\nAs the largest contributor to IDA-20, protecting the resources that go to these countries is a top priority of the United States. This is why we strongly support efforts by IDA management to responsibly boost IDA\u2019s capacity using existing resources, in addition to our own potential contribution to the CRW+, and we look forward to a successful IDA-21 replenishment next year.\n\nWe welcome the efforts of the World Bank and other MDBs to drive food system transformation and strengthen food security through medium and long-term investment, policy reforms, and technical assistance, including through the IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity launched last year. Coordination plays a key role, and we are actively working with the MDBs to institutionalize the coherent approach fostered by the Action Plan, and applying lessons learned to future work.\n\nBuilding resilience to shocks arising from global challenges is critical, which is why we must press forward with policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The World Bank and other MDBs are key providers of public climate finance, mobilizers of private finance towards emissions mitigation and climate change adaptation, and supporters of innovative financing tools that accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The World Bank should screen all projects for cost-effective climate benefits, particularly to build resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change. It is also critical that climate finance be targeted efficiently, and we urge alignment of global financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement and investment standards that incorporate transparency and accountability. World Bank Country Climate and Development reports should serve a standard-setting function, helping countries advance their climate agendas by informing the design of the International Financial Institutions\u2019 projects and programs, including specific and ambitious reforms for the country to implement. Mobilizing the private sector is also instrumental to achieve progress towards our collective climate ambition. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) are a promising model for mobilizing and aligning public, private, and philanthropic capital for the energy infrastructure and social investments needed to accelerate the transition towards a cleaner energy future in ways that benefit all communities.\n\nWe recognize that the climate finance architecture is complex and developing countries can struggle to access available financing. While an important source of financing, including much needed concessional financing, the climate finance architecture is not optimized to help countries access finance easily or to deliver finance at scale where the need is greatest or where the impact will be highest. This is why the United States, working closely with partners, including the incoming G20 and G7 presidencies, is initiating an effort to review the climate finance architecture, with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. As an implementing entity and host to some of the largest climate investment funds, the World Bank has an important role to play. We call on the World Bank to assess how it can do a better job in helping countries access climate finance and help them to blend concessional resources from the specialized climate and environment funds with the Bank\u2019s own resources. By partnering with others, the World Bank strengthens the overall architecture.\n\nThe enormous infrastructure gap in developing countries and emerging markets continues to hold back economic growth, the delivery of basic services, and trade. We must do more to maximize the capabilities of the World Bank to support infrastructure development, including in the energy, transportation, health, digital, and critical minerals arenas. Doing so will require stepped up efforts on project preparation and structuring\u2014including scaling up the Global Infrastructure Facility\u2014increasing access to knowledge and data, and assisting the implementation of policy reforms to create a more inviting environment for private investment. The United States and its partners are proud to be focusing on significantly scaling up private capital mobilization to help close the infrastructure gap, including as a core component of the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI). Under PGI, the G7 is prioritizing strengthening supply chains, especially for critical minerals, with the creation of the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership.\n\nThree years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it is evident that threats to global health can disrupt entire societies and the global economy. That is why the United States remains committed to improving regional and global health security, and our contribution to the Pandemic Fund will catalyze investments to fill critical gaps in pandemic preparedness and bolster overall health security. Recognizing the continuing risk of pandemic spillover, the World Bank should incorporate health-related risks and vulnerabilities, including an assessment for country pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response capacities, into its current work. The World Bank will also need to coordinate with partners and with other efforts underway to strengthen the global health architecture.\n\nOver the last decade, violent conflict has spiked, causing immense human suffering, contributing to extreme poverty and to the significant displacement of people, while also stunting economic growth and absorbing a large share of national budgets. We need strong collective action to mitigate the widespread impact of greater fragility and forced displacement. The United States is committed to strengthening global resiliency and democratic renewal, and promoting peaceful, self-reliant nations that become strong economic and security partners capable of addressing shared challenges. As part of the evolution initiative, and learning from the mid-term review of the Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence, we welcome the World Bank integrating new diagnostics, incentives, and approaches into its operations that address the root causes and impacts of fragility, conflict, and violence to help build countries\u2019 resilience to potential fragility drivers within the country and spillovers from neighboring countries. We urge the World Bank to redouble efforts to anchor and leverage strategic partnerships with peer institutions, civil society, and the private sector to strengthen its ability to respond with agility and impact in fragile contexts.\n\nThe United States strongly supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the bold action needed to address global challenges that threaten to set back progress on achieving the SDGs. The World Bank has made good progress with the Gender Strategy Update, and the Equality of Opportunity for Sexual Gender Minorities report, but it can do more to combat discriminatory laws and policies, along with their economic impacts, social and cultural norms around economic roles and responsibilities, and gender-based violence in its programming. These considerations should be front and center as the World Bank assesses business and investment climates worldwide through the B-Ready report.\n\nAccountability and transparency in the multilateral institutions is essential for MDB projects to be successful, and for greater development impact and effectiveness. This is why the United States will continue to press for greater access to, and disclosure of, information; stronger environmental and social safeguards, and robust governance; a culture of learning and accountability; and transparent and competitive procurement practices that are consistent with sustainable development. We look forward to upcoming reviews that will bolster the World Bank\u2019s sustainability, environmental and social framework, and accountability mechanisms. The World Bank must continue to strengthen its approach to avoiding, reducing and mitigating harm in its projects. Finally, corruption disproportionately hurts the poorest, undermining the World Bank\u2019s ability to eliminate extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity, and build resilience. There must be a culture of compliance across all levels of the Bank.\n\nAs we work towards a better World Bank that is fit for 21st century challenges, we recognize the efforts undertaken by World Bank President Ajay Banga, senior management, and the thousands of staff who have tirelessly worked towards this goal. We are grateful for their energy, creativity, dedication, and collaborative spirit. They represent multilateralism at is best \u2013 collective work to meet the world\u2019s most critical needs and to meet the moment with great impact.\n\n###"}, {"title": "Breakingviews - China's timid bank buying sends rescue signals - Reuters", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 15:45:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China is responding. Economists and fund managers have been lobbying for Beijing to buy stocks directly to prop up the country\u2019s equity markets which has been slammed by outflows. The call was partly answered on Wednesday evening by Central Huijin Investment, though not quite in the way it was hoped.\n\nThe state fund boosted its controlling stakes in the Big Four lenders by just a few basis points. It spent a 477 million yuan ($65 million) on Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), (1398.HK), China Construction Bank (601939.SS), (0939.HK) and Bank of China (601988.SS), (3988.HK), and Agricultural Bank of China (601288.SS), (1288.HK). It\u2019s a tiny amount but Central Huijin said it plans to keep adding over the next six months to its holdings already worth 2.5 trillion yuan.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nThis is not a stablisation fund of dreams. Huijin\u2019s latest move is dwarfed by Beijing\u2019s effort in 2015 to avert a market meltdown, when the state fund spent some 20 billion yuan - about $3 billion at current exchange rates - to acquire banking shares owned by other state entities, and freed up capital for the latter to mop up billions worth of mainland-traded shares. That intervention ultimately failed to improve sentiment especially among foreign investors and preceded a record $725 billion net capital outflows in 2016, per Institute of International Finance. Indeed, Central Huijin has refrained from imposing itself on the stock market as frequently as it did between 2008 and 2013, when it raised its stakes in the lenders multiple times.\n\nNonetheless, the market cheered with the Big Four lenders gaining as much as 6% in Hong Kong on Thursday. China\u2019s banks have been bracing for the impact of unresolved debt problems in property and local government financing vehicles that pose a systematic financial risk to the world\u2019s second largest economy. That\u2019s one reason Chinese banks on average trade at barely half book value, compared to more than par before 2015 when there was also a housing crisis.\n\nBeijing\u2019s latest cautious move looks designed not to spook the market as it did before and may signal the start of something prudent if lenders start to properly recognise soured loans and require recapitalising. That recognition of the problem would be the logical and most sensible end point of President Xi Jinping\u2019s deleveraging campaign. By helping the group attain a richer value, the government could also ultimately reduce its own pain.\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\nCentral Huijin Investment has bought about $65 million worth of A-shares in China\u2019s big four state lenders and plans to further increase its controlling shareholdings in the next six months, the banks said on Oct. 11. The state fund is the biggest shareholder in Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.\n\nEditing by Una Galani and Thomas Shum\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Eskom said in August that its transmission arm would not be operational until 2025.\n\nThe World Bank loan would also support South Africa to make a \"just transition\" away from coal, to ensure vulnerable people do not suffer as a result, Marie-Nelly said.\n\nShe said the government was \"also looking at the broader climate agenda, including looking at the carbon tax.\"\n\nIn November 2022, the World Bank approved $497 million in financing to decommission and repurpose one of Eskom's coal-fired power plants.\n\n($1 = 18.9804 rand)\n\nReporting by Rachel Savage and Jorgelina do Rosario; Editing by Kopano Gumbi, Mark Potter and Mike Harrison\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "IMF says 'weak tail' of banks could struggle in an economic downturn - Reuters", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 12:04:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "[1/4] The International Monetary Fund (IMF) logo is seen outside the headquarters building in Washington, U.S., September 4, 2018.

Its \"severe-but-plausible\" scenario envisages the global economy entering \"stagflation.\"\n\n\"Under the baseline, it's about 5% of banks that are relatively weak in terms of their capital. And in severe stress, that number goes up to 30% or sometimes higher,\" Adrian said.\n\nThe IMF did not identify the banks that could be in trouble if those economic circumstances arose, but they included both small and large lenders.\n\n\"There's certainly some large institutions that could be under pressure in some scenarios, absolutely,\" Adrian said, though he noted the recent U.S. banking crisis showed how even smaller bank failures could undermine financial stability.\n\nGovernments need to aggressively supervise their banks, and examiners must be more \"intrusive\" and direct lenders must take more \"timely and conclusive\" corrective action, the IMF said. It also said there was an \"urgent need\" to improve bank resilience by boosting capital levels.\n\nThe report was issued as global financial leaders gathered in Marrakech, Morocco, for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings.\n\nINFLATION BATTLE\n\nRecent ructions in government bond markets have been orderly, Adrian told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. \"The rise in yields has been quick, but we haven't seen sort of like forced deleveraging or other market dysfunction,\" Adrian said.\n\nThe difference in bond yields between German government bonds and those of southern European countries such as Italy which blew out during the sovereign debt crisis a decade ago remain \"well contained\", he added.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 led to heavy losses on the government bond portfolios held by regional U.S. banks, which in turn spooked depositors and led to a string of failures in March and early May of this year.\n\nThe U.S. central bank held its benchmark overnight interest rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range last month, but signaled one more quarter-percentage-point hike would likely be needed before the end of this year to cement inflation's downward path, and that the policy rate would probably end 2024 above 5%.\n\nWeak banks were considered those whose capital levels fell by more than five percentage points over the course of the IMF's stress test, or below a floor of 7%.\n\nUnder its baseline, 55 banks representing 4% of global assets proved weak. Under the stagflation scenario, that number expanded to 215 banks holding 42% of assets.\n\nThe report urged central banks to stick with higher rates until inflation cools, but warned that some investors appear to be too confident that inflation will fall quickly. \"History cautions against declaring victory too soon and prematurely easing monetary policy,\" the report noted.\n\nReporting by Pete Schroeder; editing by Michelle Price, Paul Simao and Chizu Nomiyama\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "China ramps up liquidity support to banking system - Reuters", "date": "Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:02:18 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "Paramilitary police officers stand guard in front of the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the central bank (PBOC), in Beijing, China September 30, 2022.

In total, the proportion of mortgages lasting 35 years or more had increased from 4% in the first three months of the year to 12% in the second quarter.\n\nThe UK has a relatively short-term mortgage market compared with some countries, including the US, where the average mortgage term is 23.3 years.\n\n\u201cWhile longer mortgage terms and other forbearance measures could reduce pressures on borrowers in the short term, they could increase debt burdens over the long term,\u201d the committee said.\n\nThe FPC also noted an increase in borrowers falling into arrears \u2013 albeit from low levels \u2013 and expected the number of customers falling behind on their debts to increase.\n\nBanks had simultaneously started to tighten their lending, amid fears over the economic outlook. But overall, the UK banking system was broadly in good health and asset quality remained \u201crelatively stable\u201d, the FPC said.\n\nHowever, it said the potential risks were \u201csomewhat\u201d offset by rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which require banks to be responsible lenders.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank announced it would pause its normal stress tests, which ensure that the UK\u2019s largest high street lenders can withstand severe financial shocks and an extreme downturn in the UK and global economy.\n\nInstead, it would run a \u201cdesk-based scenario\u201d \u2013 similar to checks conducted during the Covid crisis \u2013 which would measure the health of the banking system as a whole, without having to publish the results of individual lenders.\n\nThe committee said this would allow it to test banks\u2019 balance sheets against more than one scenario, including whether interest rates stayed higher for longer, or suddenly dropped and affected banks\u2019 incomes.\n\nThis would also give policymakers an opportunity to review the normal stress-testing regime, which was implemented after the financial crisis and could end up including a broader range of lenders, including smaller banks.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were honored to be joined by the Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko.\n\nWe express our deepest condolences to the victims and their families affected by the earthquakes in Morocco and Afghanistan as well as the floods in Libya. We are committed to providing necessary assistance. We hope that the successful World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakech will accelerate Morocco\u2019s strong recovery from the disaster. We unequivocally condemn the recent terror attacks by Hamas on the State of Israel and express our solidarity with the Israeli people. We reiterate our unwavering support for Ukraine and are united in our condemnation of Russia\u2019s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Russia\u2019s war has caused tragic loss of life, destruction of property and infrastructure, increased global food insecurity, and exacerbated global economic challenges. We remain determined to foster international cooperation to address the global economic hardships caused by Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and its weaponization of food and energy. In this context, we urge Russia to end its attacks on Ukrainian grain supplies and infrastructure and to expeditiously restore the Black Sea Grain Initiative to improve supply to the global market and reduce food price volatility. We call on Russia to immediately end its illegal war against Ukraine, which would clear one of the biggest uncertainties over the global economic outlook. We will continue our efforts to ensure that Russia pays for the long-term reconstruction of Ukraine. We will also explore all possible avenues to aid Ukraine, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. We welcome the initial effort by the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force to account for Russia\u2019s sovereign assets immobilized and held in REPO member jurisdictions which is at this stage estimated at around USD 280 billion and expect the REPO Task Force to refine this initial effort over the coming months. We recall and reaffirm our Leaders\u2019 Statement that, consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia\u2019s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. We reiterate our unwavering resolve to impose and enforce sanctions and other economic measures to further undermine Russia\u2019s capacity to wage its illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression. We remain committed to countering any attempts to evade and undermine our sanction measures. We will continue to strengthen coordination in monitoring cross-border transactions between Russia and other countries, take further action directed at the Russian financial sector as necessary, and closely monitor the effectiveness of the price caps on Russian crude oil and petroleum products to ensure the measure delivers on its objectives, and take any necessary and appropriate enforcement actions required. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. We remain strongly committed to supporting Ukraine\u2019s urgent short-term financing needs, as well as assisting its neighboring and other severely affected countries. Building on the successful completion of the first review of the IMF program for Ukraine, and looking ahead to the second review, we will continue our joint efforts to help address Ukraine's 2024 financing needs. We look forward to continued implementation of structural reforms by Ukraine and successful completion of the upcoming reviews, which will promote macroeconomic and financial stabilization, enhance governance and strengthen institutions, contribute to longer-term economic sustainability and post-war reconstruction. We will continue to support Ukraine\u2019s repair of its critical infrastructure, recovery and reconstruction, including through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine. We will explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, where those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations towards Russia under applicable laws, could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with applicable laws. We welcome the successful launch of the \u201cPartnership for RISE (Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement)\u201d in collaboration with the WBG. This was achieved through financial and other contributions from G7 members, non-G7 countries and international organizations, and we call on more interested parties to join this important initiative. RISE aims to support low- and middle-income countries in playing bigger roles in the midstream and downstream in supply chains of clean energy products. Diversifying supply chains can contribute to safeguarding energy security, supporting macroeconomic stability and resilience, strengthening capacity-building, and achieving net zero. We continue to support the implementation of RISE with speed and quality, including through pilot local information platforms to share relevant on-the-ground information and identify issues to be addressed by RISE. We will continue to coordinate on further enhancing supply chain resilience. We reiterate our commitment to supporting emerging market and developing economies, particularly low-income countries, in dealing with multiple and complex challenges including climate change and food insecurity. In doing so, we recognize the important role of public finance in leveraging private capital through multilateral and bilateral initiatives. We also recognize the importance of improving business environments to attract more private investment in recipient countries and of supporting the mobilization of domestic resources. We welcome the strategy developed by the OECD to expand and deepen its outreach with non-OECD members, to support them in attracting more, better, and safe FDI. We also support the OECD\u2019s Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA). The G7-Africa Ministerial Roundtable to be held on 14 October 2023 builds on last year\u2019s successful meeting and offers an opportunity for Finance Ministers of G7 members and the G20 Presidency to discuss with Finance Ministers of African countries how to further mobilize financing to Africa. We remain committed to further strengthening financial and economic collaboration and political dialogue with African countries and other emerging market and developing economies. We reiterate our firm commitment to support progress of the G20\u2019s discussion on key issues such as debt, MDB evolution, robust and sustainable PRGT, and IMF quota review. We continue to support the G20\u2019s efforts to step up the implementation of the Common Framework in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. We call for the finalization of the MOU on the debt treatment for Zambia as quickly as possible and swift agreements on debt treatments for Ghana and Ethiopia. We welcome significant progress at the official creditor committee towards agreement on debt treatment for Sri Lanka and look forward to its swift resolution. We welcome efforts to explore the integration of Climate-Resilient Debt Clauses in lending instruments and encourage more creditors to offer these. While welcoming the initial progress shown in the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review Roadmap with a potential additional lending headroom of at least USD 200 billion over the next decade, we urge MDBs to continue their steadfast efforts to further implement the CAF recommendations. For the WBG, we will deliver on the G20 Leaders\u2019 commitment to collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank\u2019s capacity to support low and middle-income countries that need help in addressing global challenges, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. We will also play a proactive role and work closely with other shareholders in agreeing on a clear framework for allocating scarce concessional resources in a well-targeted and well-prioritized manner with a view to safeguarding global public goods, while continuing to prioritize the needs of the poorest countries. We will decide on the best options to contribute to these initiatives. We are committed to collectively securing an ambitious IDA 21 replenishment next year to support low-income countries. At the IMF, we also support the work to ensure the PRGT is on a sustainable footing to meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We continue our utmost efforts to ensure a swift and timely conclusion of the 16th General Review of Quotas of the IMF with a quota increase agreed by 15 December 2023. We reaffirm our May 2017 exchange rate commitments. We look forward to an ambitious replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) resources at the end of the year.\n\n###"}, {"title": "OCP Group and World Bank Join Forces to Boost Food Security and ... - World Bank Group", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 13:02:49 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.worldbank.org", "title": "World Bank Group"}, "text": "The partnership will unlock opportunities for African farmers to improve agricultural productivity and soil health through the use of customized fertilizers and sustainable farming practices.\n\nMARRAKECH, October 11, 2023 \u2013 The World Bank and the OCP Group today announced a game changing partnership to support farmers in West Africa and the Sahel.\n\nAt the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakech, the OCP Chairman Mostafa Terrab and World Bank Vice President for Western and Central Africa Ousmane Diagana signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to foster cooperation and programs benefitting five million farmers in Benin, Guinea, Mali, and Togo, covering 10 million hectares.

The road was completely closed for two hours.\n\n\u201cI feel afraid and my nerves are high while travelling because the roads are not safe and the settlers block and attack Palestinian cars with stones at many intersections within the West Bank,\u201d Dweikat said. \u201cSometimes it takes some drivers five hours to get from one governorate to another.\u201d\n\nFor Abu Shams, the human rights activist, this is all part of a calculated Israeli plan to pressure and cause a displacement of the Palestinian population whether in the occupied West Bank or the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cIt is not a hidden agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Israel far-right ministers have announced more than once that they want a land without Palestinian residents, and they promised their voters, as part of their electoral campaigns, to implement that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, they want to implement a third Nakba by spreading chaos and disrupting Palestinian institutions in more than one place, especially those that provide services to society.\u201d"}, {"title": "European investment bank to offer Morocco $1 billion euro loan - Reuters", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 17:30:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "[1/2] People work next to damage in the city of Marrakech, following a powerful earthquake in Morocco, September 9, 2023.

As wind turbines get bigger, the vessels that install them are having to change, too. VCG | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nA project to build a facility described as \"the world's largest offshore wind farm\" took a big step forward this month by producing its first power. Located in the North Sea, over 130 kilometers off England's northeast coast, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm still has some way to go before it's fully operational, but the installation and powering up of its first turbine is a major feat in itself. That's because GE Vernova's Haliade-X turbines stand 260 meters tall \u2014 that's higher than San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge \u2014 and have blades measuring 107 meters. Turbine installation at Dogger Bank has required a huge amount of planning and preparation, with the Voltaire \u2014 a specialist vessel designed and built by the family-owned Jan De Nul Group \u2014 playing a key role. With a lifting capacity of 3,200 metric tons, the Voltaire \u2014 named after the 18th-century French philosopher \u2014 will have installed a total of 277 Haliade-X turbines when its work is complete.\n\nThis image, from Dec. 2022, shows Jan De Nul Group's Voltaire in China. A specialist installation vessel, the Voltaire has a lifting capacity of over 3,000 metric tons. VCG | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nDescribed by Dogger Bank as the \"largest offshore jack-up installation vessel ever built,\" in many ways, it's the pinnacle of an extensive supply chain involving numerous businesses and stakeholders. The logistics are complex and multi-layered, with water depth a particular issue. The sea in the Dogger Bank Offshore Development Zone is up to 63 meters deep, meaning the Voltaire's ability to work in deeper waters is crucial. This is where its four legs come into play. According to Jan De Nul, the legs of the Voltaire \u2014 which was built at the COSCO Shipping Shipyard in China \u2014 enable it to lift itself above the water's surface. With each leg measuring roughly 130 meters in length, they highlight the scale of equipment required to install huge offshore wind turbines like GE's Haliade-X. In an online Q&A before installations at Dogger Bank began, Jan De Nul's Rutger Standaert spoke of their importance. \"Thanks to those legs, the Voltaire can effectively operate at a water depth of 80 meters,\" Standaert, who is manager of vessel construction at the business, said. He noted that the Voltaire's capabilities would enable installations further out to sea, allowing it to play a key role in the emerging floating offshore wind sector. \"Off the Scottish coast, for example, expensive floating windfarms are often the only way to tap into offshore wind,\" he said. \"The water is too deep for fixed windfarms, but the Voltaire can offer new opportunities.\" Thinking big Once completed, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm will have a total capacity of 3.6 gigawatts (GW) and be able to power as many as six million homes per year, according to its developers. Work on the project is taking place over three phases: Dogger Bank A, B, and C. A fourth phase of the wind farm known as Dogger Bank D has also been proposed, and would increase its capacity even further.\n\nS\u00f8ren Lassen is head of offshore wind research at Wood Mackenzie, a research and consultancy group. He described Dogger Bank as \"a huge project, especially if you combine the three phases.\" \"It is a project that requires a lot of preparation,\" he told CNBC. \"There's the logistics in terms of having the vessels to do the installation ... and then of course, you also have the logistics in terms of getting the components to the marshaling port.\" Both of these aspects were being made \"a lot more complicated\" by the use of next-generation turbines and a next-generation installation vessel, Lassen said. \"You have ... a lot of innovation that goes into this. And not only do you need a new vessel or new components, you also need new factories to build those components.\" As such, a slew of upgrades and adjustments were needed to \"reverberate throughout the entire value chain\" for operations to run smoothly, he added. Bigger turbines, bigger challenges?\n\nThis image, from June 2023, shows tower sections of GE's Haliade-X wind turbine at a site in the U.S. David L. Ryan | The Boston Globe | Getty Images\n\nThanks to their sheer size, larger turbine designs have created a specific set of needs for the offshore wind sector and sites like the Dogger Bank Wind Farm. \"From cranes to vessels, we use a number of specially designed pieces of equipment to transport the Haliade-X turbines that will be used in this project,\" a spokesperson for GE Offshore Wind said in a statement sent to CNBC. Wood Mackenzie's Lassen stressed the importance of having dedicated transportation vessels, noting that the towers of turbines need to be broken into three or four sections in order to fit on board. Massive blades represent the biggest challenge, he said, as they have to be laid flat. \"And that just means that you need a very, very long transportation vessel, [and] that you need to stack them up accordingly.\"\n\nBlades of the Haliade-X turbine stacked on top of each other at a site in the U.S. The past few years have seen companies develop increasingly large wind turbines.

John Wessels | Afp | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 An ambassador of an African country to China has criticized the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for restrictive lending policies. \"The problem is that the ratings we are making for the African [countries] should be different,\" Ibrahima Sory Sylla, ambassador for the West African country of Senegal, said Thursday at an event at Peking University. He said ratings from Fitch or Standard and Poor's don't take into account local factors such as food security \u2014 but they are the basis for IMF and World Bank assessments of economic sustainability. The number of people in West Africa experiencing an acute lack of food surged by nearly 40% in a year, according to a Reuters report in December citing the United Nation's World Food Programme. The figure surged 60% during that time for the number of East Africans, the report said. Senegal significantly increased its borrowing from China in 2021 and 2022, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa database managed by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.\n\nwatch now\n\nWhile that reflected a spike in West African borrowing, such loan activity was more muted in other parts of Africa \u2014 reversing a growth trend of the last 20 years, the data showed. \"What we can understand is that so many [multilateral development banks] through the G20 [debt] suspension initiative, they said you have to go through this initiative, but when you [do so], they suddenly decided to downgrade your risk,\" Senegal's Sylla said. \"And most of the developed countries, the Western countries, they can go beyond to 200% of the ratio between the debt and the GDP. Their rating is not downgraded.\" The IMF, World Bank and S&P did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A Fitch Ratings spokesperson told CNBC all its sovereign rating decisions are \"taken solely in accordance with one globally consistent and publicly available rating criteria.\" \"Rating decisions are based on independent, robust, transparent and timely analysis,\" the person added.\n\nI cannot deny that the financing cooperation between China and Africa are facing some challenge or difficulties, because [of] some countr[ies] defaulting... Wu Peng China's foreign ministry, African affairs\n\n\"My sincere belief is that IMF officials, World Bank officials, they are sincere in their belief that their debt sustainability framework works and works for the greater good,\" said Jang Ping Thia, lead economist and manager of the economics department at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. \"Many times, the IMF chief at the desk, try their best to stretch the envelope for the country,\" Thia said at the same event Thursday. Thia said he just returned from a trip to Africa two weeks ago and saw a \"brand-new city\" being built by many Chinese contractors \u2014 but with very low occupancy. \"That makes me very worried,\" he said, declining to name the specific African country. \"The loan itself matters, infrastructure matters, but timing and debt management and absorption capacity matters, coordinating and staggering out and having a plan,\" said the AIIB economist. \"Build slowly, get people in, build more, is sometimes much more efficient, maybe not as big [a] bang.\"\n\nBelt and Road Forum\n\nThe event about Chinese financing to Africa came just days before the country was set to hold its third Belt and Road forum, a gathering of countries involved in the China-led initiative for regional infrastructure development. Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to attend the forum, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Beijing. Critics say the Belt and Road Initiative is a way for China to expand its global influence, while forcing poor countries to take on debt for infrastructure development, only to find themselves unable to repay the loans. From 2000 to 2020, China loaned $160 billion to African countries, according to a report released Thursday by Peking University's Institute of New Structural Economics. The research claimed every 1% increase in Chinese loans resulted in an increase of 0.176% in African economic growth. Allan Joseph Chintedza, ambassador of Malawi to China, said the report should look also at the repayment period for Chinese loans. \"The gesture and what the [Belt and Road Initiative] is trying to do is perfect. It would be very sad if we actually lost out because we are not addressing some of the key issues that we need to address that you gave,\" Chintedza said, without specifying. The East African country needs to provide a \"sustainability letter\" from the Chinese government in order to borrow more from the IMF, Chintedza added. \"Instead of us concentrating on implementing these agent programs, we are caught in between negotiations of trying to raise [funds], to improve or at least justify the debts that we have.\" \"I think the majority of the loans has to be extended because that's the only way we can be given breathing space to be able to meet the requirements but also to invest in the social sense,\" he said."}, {"title": "Deutsche Bank completes takeover of UK broker Numis - Reuters", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 07:22:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "The headquarters of Germany's Deutsche Bank are pictured in Frankfurt, Germany, September 21, 2020.

But the ECB rejected the proposal in July, partly on resistance from its Executive Board, the sources said.\n\nStill, the battle is not over and proponents are looking to make a fresh push to raise the ratio next spring, when the ECB reviews its operational framework, conversations with eight sources indicate.\n\n\"This issue must come back, by the framework review, at the latest,\" one of the sources said. \"The reserve requirement is artificially low.\"\n\nEXCESS LIQUIDITY\n\nAt the core of the issue is the 3.6 trillion euros worth of excess liquidity sloshing around in the banking system, much of it created by the ECB when inflation was too low and policymakers were trying to stimulate the economy through a cash injection.\n\nInterest rates are now at a record high, so the ECB's interest expense has soared on this large pool of debt and several national central banks, including the Bundesbank, are generating a loss.\n\nBundesbank chief Joachim Nagel, his Austrian counterpart Robert Holzmann and Latvia's Martin Kazaks have all made the case for a new discussion on jacking up minimum reserve requirements, a sentiment shared by at least another half a dozen on the 26-member Governing Council.\n\nBut the sources say the ECB's board - including Isabel Schnabel, who is in charge of market operations - has not softened its opposition to the change, so any proposal faces an uphill battle.\n\nAn ECB spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAustria's Holzmann made the case this week for jacking the minimum reserves up tenfold to 10% but most sources dismissed this as too large and mentioned numbers in the 2% to 5% range.\n\nThey note that Croatia's rate was 9% before it joined the euro on Jan 1 and its banking system functioned well.\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\nA key question is whether the change serves a policy purpose or is simply viewed as a punitive device.\n\nIts supporters say that if cutting the rate to zero this year had a policy purpose, then so does increasing the multiplier, since the outcome is similar.\n\nThere are also historical precedents, and the overall impact would be to restrict banks' ability to lend, and this would help dampen inflation.\n\nThey also say that since banks benefited from the ECB's copious asset buys in the past, it is only fair they pay for some of the cost now, especially because their large profits are now being paid out to shareholders, a morally debatable outcome.\n\nAs a public institution, the ECB's job is to conduct policy at the lowest cost, so reducing losses is not inconsistent with that mandate, they argue.\n\nOpponents -- who also include France's Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Belgium's Pierre Wunsch -- meanwhile say that the main policy instrument is the interest rate and the bank is already using too many tools, so one more would overcomplicate policy.\n\nThe board's key argument is that excess liquidity is distributed unevenly across the euro zone and raising the ratio would put an excessive burden on smaller banks with a larger portion of deposits.\n\n\"The gain is miniscule and I'm yet to be convinced there is a monetary policy justification,\" another source said. \"We're not in the business of making social policy, so punishing banks is not a legitimate objective.\"\n\nIn an interview last week, Schnabel said the ECB should be cautious about making such changes before it decides on how much excess liquidity it wants to maintain over the longer term.\n\nHigher charges could also force banks to move liquidity outside the euro zone, while a small increase in ratio would cut central bank losses only by tiny amounts, so the ECB would engage in a risky policy with a modest benefit.\n\n\"Any sensible tweak - a 1% increase to 2% - in the minimum reserve requirement would have a second-order impact on the level of excess liquidity and would only save the Eurosystem (around) 6 billion euros on yearly interest payments at the current deposit rate,\" Barclays said in a note.\n\nDeutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing argued that the change would add to banks' financial burdens and restrict their lending options.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Sims;

Although both reflect the human biases that developers and creators bring to AI models, the former category is impossible to counteract just by getting rid of data points that indicate, for example, femininity or non-whiteness.\n\nBlake likened data bias to the practice of redlining in mortgage lending. In a redlining system, home insurers and mortgage lenders assess non-white customers as \u201crisky\u201d based on their neighborhood, making credit and insurance more difficult to come by for people of color, while not directly attributing denials or higher prices to race. Similar logic is already visible in AI systems, Blake noted.\n\n\u201c[T]he model may make underlying correlations that lead to biased decision-making based on non-protected features,\u201d Blake wrote. \u201cIn other words, the remaining, non-protected features could act as proxies for protected characteristics.\u201d\n\nSocietal bias, by contrast, is \u201cwhere norms and negative legacy from a society cause blind spots.\u201d Blake cited an Amazon recruitment algorithm that tended to recommend more male candidates than female, because the data, historically, showed that males tended to be hired more often.\n\nAI bias is particularly dangerous in the financial sector, Blake warned. Trust in the banking system is at serious risk from the aforementioned biases displayed by AI, given that (while noticeably less discriminatory than human decision-makers), AI still charged higher rates to Black and Latinx mortgage customers when compared white ones. Moreover, the opaque \u201cblack box\u201d nature of proprietary models means that, if a large group of important firms uses them for similar purposes, their actions could have a huge effect on the economy as a whole, and be fairly unpredictable into the bargain.\n\nBlake acknowledged that this type of destabilizing AI event hasn\u2019t happened yet, but warned that the risks are very real, citing a 2021 case in which Apple and Goldman Sachs were investigated by the New York State Department of Financial Services for algorithmically offering smaller lines of credit to women.\n\n\u201cBeyond the inherent issues with bias, fairness and ethics, this could potentially lead to stability issues for financial institutions or the financial system as a whole,\u201d Blake wrote."}, {"title": "Brokers say bank vacancies are an opportunity for retail sector - Crain's Grand Rapids Business", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 05:30:03 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.crainsgrandrapids.com", "title": "Crain's Grand Rapids Business"}, "text": "Commercial real estate experts say Michigan\u2019s position as a leader in bank branch closings is not a cause for concern, but rather an opportunity to repurpose prime retail spaces into new uses.\n\nOver the past three years, 345 bank branch offices closed across the state, ranking Michigan as fourth in the nation for the percentage of full-service offices closing, according to a LendingTree analysis previously reported by Crain\u2019s Grand Rapids Business. The closings here are driven by both a prominent bank merger as well as the decline of in-person banking that accelerated during the pandemic.\n\nThe 2021 merger between Huntington Bancshares Inc. and the former TCF Financial Corp., paired with fewer people using physical banking locations, led to the closures but also opened retail space in strong areas, experts say.\n\nKeep up with all things West Michigan business.

Those that can reuse will and have been getting absorbed quickly, especially nowadays with the cost of construction being so high.\u201d\n\nScott Stenstrom, vice president of marketing and communications for Fifth Third Bank, said the COVID-19 pandemic heightened the bank\u2019s previous efforts to examine where and how their customers prefer to do business.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at what customers do and if they\u2019re coming into a branch and that helps us adjust staffing,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes that results in a branch closing because customers are not coming there anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve closed some over the past couple years and a lot of times it\u2019s been where we might have two or three branches (nearby) and one has the lion\u2019s share of transactions over the others,\u201d Stenstrom added.\n\nFifth Third has closed 33 branch offices in Michigan since 2019, according to FDIC data, including prominent buildings in downtown Traverse City in 2018 and in downtown Holland in 2022.

I put the Storm 2 through the paces to see how well it would stand up -- and I came away impressed.\n\nThe Shargeek Storm 2 has already made ZDNET's list of best battery banks for 2023, so you might want to read that before continuing on (as this will be all about my experience with the charger).\n\nThe specs\n\nAs far as specs are concerned, the most important one you should know about is this: The Shargeek Storm 2 has a massive bank of batteries that total 25600mAh of power. Beyond that, it includes:\n\nIPS Screen to help visualize battery life, output distribution, running temperature, and DC voltage adjustment\n\n100W PD Fast Charging via the USB C port\n\nUniversal compatibility with 2 USB C ports, 1 USB B port, and one adjustable DC port\n\nThe Shargeek Storm 2 includes the power bank and a USB C cable. That's it. But that's really all you need. Although the price might seem steep (at $229 on Amazon), the amount of charge you get with the device is worth it (especially if you're concerned about losing power when inclement weather arrives).\n\nMy experience with the Storm 2\n\nThe first thing you must understand is that you can only charge the Storm 2 either with the DC input or the vertical USB C port on the left side of the port panel.\n\nMake sure to use the USB C port on the left side to charge the power bank. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nYou'll know it's charging when you see a number displayed by the IN square on the LCD panel. If you plug the USB C cord into the right side port, you'll see nothing registered coming in.\n\nThe good news is that you also can charge devices with either the left or right side port.\n\nBut what about charging devices with the Storm 2? How did that work out? My test involved two different devices: A Pixel Pro 7 and an Android tablet.\n\nFor my test, I let the phone run down to single-digit battery percentage and the tablet to zero. I then fully charged the devices (one at a time) and let them completely run down again. I was able to do this five times with the phone and three times with the tablet. That's not exactly up to the claims the Storm 2 makes, but there is a caveat to my testing.\n\nAlso: The best MagSafe battery packs you can buy (including for iPhone 15)\n\nOn two occasions I left the phone and tablet plugged in overnight to see if the Storm 2 could automatically sense the devices were fully charged and shut down. My experience indicates that this is not the case.\n\nTo verify that, I reset my test and only charged the devices when I could monitor the charging and unplug the device as soon as it was fully charged. This method bore fruit and the Storm 2 lived up to its claims of up to seven charges for a phone. I was also able to get five full charges for the tablet.\n\nThe caveat\n\nThe only nit I have to pick with the Storm 2 is that the LCD screen is very small. In fact, the screen is so small that my aging eyes found it impossible to read. To find out how much percentage of charge the device had remaining, I had to use my phone's camera app and zoom in. Otherwise, those tiny numbers were just a blur.\n\nIt takes some serious zooming for these aging eyes to see what's on the display. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nIf you have younger eyes, you might not have a problem seeing the readouts on the screen. But even with my glasses on, those itty bitty numbers might as well not even be there.\n\nAlso: This $10 gadget is my favorite repair tool of all time\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThat's pretty impressive for a device measuring 1.81 x 2.32 x 5.94 inches and weighing 1.25 pounds. Granted, the Storm 2 isn't going to outperform something like the FJDynamics Pony 500, but if you need something smaller (and a lot cheaper), the Storm 2 might be the ideal power bank to have on hand for when the weather threatens to take out your power."}, {"title": "Japan, World Bank launch project to diversify energy supply chain - Reuters", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 14:30:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "Participants attend the second day of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, following last month's deadly earthquake, in Marrakech, Morocco, October 10, 2023.

However, that was unlikely to compel the BOK to resume hiking rates as the central bank expected a brief rise in inflation before cooling by year-end.\n\nAll 49 economists in the Oct. 10-16 poll predicted the BOK would leave the base rate (KROCRT=ECI) unchanged at 3.50% on Thursday as the central bank, the first among its peers to hike rates, keeps a close eye on already slowing economic activity.\n\nThe South Korean economy, with one of the world's highest household debt-to-GDP ratios, is taking a hit from a cumulative 300 basis points of rate hikes.\n\nStill, median forecasts showed interest rates remaining unchanged at least until end-Q1 2024, followed by a 25 basis point cut in Q2. In August, the first rate cut was expected to come by end-Q1.\n\n\"Slowing growth and elevated financial stress will justify rate hold at 3.50%.

They did not expect any imminent changes to sanctions.\n\nThe work by UK Finance - which represents around 300 firms, including HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) - examines the transparency of asset ownership and control and how easily Chinese products can be traced, Whiley said.\n\nIt also focuses on the extent of commercial ties between the West and China across industries, including supply chains in high-risk sectors like technology, and attempts to highlight measures that might backfire if applied to China.\n\nThe work has been carried out against a backdrop of tensions between the West and China over the status of Taiwan, which Beijing claims, growing export controls, accusations of Chinese spying and a security crackdown by Beijing on companies.\n\nUK Finance convened fortnightly meetings of big British and overseas banks over several months, Whiley said, before drawing up a draft document that runs to tens of thousands of words. Reuters was not able to review the document.\n\nThe draft was completed in August and shared with Western government contacts in recent weeks, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department, which runs the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, Britain's Foreign Office and Barclays did not respond to requests for comment.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nBEIJING, Oct 17 (Reuters) - China has told state-owned banks to roll over existing local government debt with longer-term loans at lower interest rates, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, as part of Beijing's efforts to reduce debt risks in a faltering economy.\n\nDebt-laden municipalities represent a major risk to the world's second-largest economy and its financial stability, economists say, amid a deepening property crisis, years of over-investment in infrastructure and soaring costs to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLocal government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.58 trillion), or 76% of the country's economic output in 2022, up from 62.2% in 2019.\n\nPart of that is debt issued by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), which cities use to raise money for infrastructure projects, often at the urging of the central government when it needs to boost economic growth. Empty coffers could make it harder for Beijing to kickstart a sputtering economic recovery.\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) issued orders last week to major state lenders to extend terms, adjust repayment plans, and reduce interest rates on outstanding loans to LGFVs, according to the sources.\n\nLoans that were due in 2024 or before will be categorized as \"normal\" instead of non-performing if they overdue, and that won't affect banks' performance evaluations, one of the sources said. Reuters is reporting these measures for banks to defuse local debt risks for the first time.\n\nTo ensure banks do not incur heavy losses from the debt restructuring, interest rates on rolled over loans should not be below China's Treasury bond rates, said one source, adding that loan terms should not exceed 10 years. China's benchmark 10-year government bond is now yielding around 2.7%, while the benchmark one-year loan prime rate is 3.45%.\n\nThe two sources declined to be identified as the policies were confidential.\n\n\"The borrowing costs of LGFVs' loans are usually about 4%, and in some regions and cases the costs could be even higher at about 5% to 8%,\" said a banker, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to media.\n\n\"A large-scale loan extension and interest rate reduction will deal a heavy blow to banks' operations,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the mounting local fiscal mess, China's central government has taken a cautious stance on resolving the debt issues to avoid risks of moral hazard: Investors could be encouraged to take even greater risks if they assume Beijing will always come to the rescue of local governments or state companies.\n\nChina's deepening property crisis has added to the pressure on municipalities, with developers in no shape to buy more land, traditionally a key source of local revenue. Since the sector's debt crisis unfolded in mid-2021, companies accounting for 40% of Chinese home sales have defaulted, most of them private developers.\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the National Financial Regulatory Administration didn't immediately reply to Reuters' request for comments.\n\nMAJOR RISKS\n\nChina's Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, said in late July said it would announce a basket of measures to reduce local government debt risks, but no detailed plans have been officially unveiled yet.\n\nGradually paying off total local government debt over 20 years would require annual payments of 6.5 trillion yuan, analysts at ANZ Research said in a note last week. That's larger than China's estimated annual nominal GDP growth over the next decade, they said.\n\nThe central bank said it will prioritize resolving debt risks in 12 regions identified as \"high risk\", including Tianjin city, Guizhou province and Guangxi province, with a focus on open market bonds and non-standard debt products due this year and next year, the sources said.\n\nBanks are being encouraged to issue new loans to LGFVs to repay bonds and non-standard debt, the sources said.\n\nAnd, Chinese investors are rushing to buy bonds of LGFVs, including from the riskiest issuers, as Beijing's attempts to reduce local debt risks encourages them to bet on an implicit government guarantee.\n\nDEBT PAYMENT CLIFF\n\nLGFVs face significant bond maturity pressure in 2023 and the first half of 2024, according to a research note by UBS. Over 2.1 trillion yuan LGFV bonds matured in the first half of 2023, and another 1.75 trillion yuan in the second half of this year and 1.69 trillion yuan in the first half of 2024, the highest maturity pressure in history, the note said.\n\nAdditionally, the PBOC will set up an emergency tool with banks to offer loans to LGFVs to solve any short-term liquidity stress, the two sources said. LGFVs will need to repay the loans within two years, a second source said.\n\nFinancial news outlet Caixin first reported the central bank's emergency liquidity tool in August.\n\nIn the 12 high-risk regions, some local governments will need to pledge or transfer part of their stakes in local state-owned companies to banks in exchange for assistance from banks to roll over loans, the second source said.\n\nLast year, a Chinese government financing unit in the southwestern Guizhou province extended loans worth $2.3 billion by 20 years, which adjusted interest rates to between 3% and 4.5% per year.\n\n($1 = 7.3146 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\nReporting by Beijing Newsroom; Additional reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Kim Coghill\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "Flagstar Bank MOVEit Breach Affects 800K Customer Records - Infosecurity Magazine", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:30:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com", "title": "Infosecurity Magazine"}, "text": "Flagstar Bank, a prominent Michigan-based financial services provider, has warned 837,390 of its US customers about a data breach that occurred through a third-party service provider, Fiserv.\n\nThe breach exposed the personal information of a substantial number of customers.

But each stands out in their own way. Live Oak excels at SBA loans. The lender gives the highest SBA loan amounts and has qualified as the top SBA lender in the country. U.S. Bank stands out for its fast business loan option and its equipment loans.\n\nLive Oak vs. U.S. Bank at a glance\n\nU.S. Bank offers lower starting loan amounts and more loan types, but Live Oak Bank has a higher loan amount limit.\n\nLive Oak U.S. Bank Bankrate Score 3.0 4.1 Best for SBA loans Equipment loans Number of loan products 4 6 Loan amounts $150,000 to $15 million $5,000 to 12.4 million Interest rates Not stated Starting at 7.99% APR Term lengths Up to 25 years 2 to 25 years Personal credit score 650 Not stated Minimum time in business Two years Not stated Minimum business revenue Not stated Not stated\n\nLive Oak business loans\n\nLive Oak offers several types of business financing, including SBA loans, USDA loans and commercial loans. Businesses can apply for both SBA 7(a) loans and SBA 504 loans.\n\nThe lender also practices inclusive lending practices. Live Oak works to provide funding specifically for small business types that traditionally don\u2019t have as much access to funding. These business types include veteran-owned, minority-owned and women-owned businesses.\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to see eligibility requirements for a small business loan through Live Oak before applying. The lender doesn\u2019t provide details like interest rates or required time in business, which makes it difficult for small business owners to compare lenders to find the most affordable option quickly.\n\nPros\n\nSBA Preferred Lender\n\nInclusive lending practices\n\nGenerous loan limits\n\nCons\n\nMinimal loan details provided\n\nNo online prequalification\n\nSome industry restrictions\n\nLightbulb Bankrate insight Since 2018, Live Oak has consistently been the top SBA 7(a) lender by loan amount. In 2023, it approved over $1.8 billion in SBA 7(a) funds, according to the SBA lender report.\n\nU.S. Bank business loans\n\nU.S. Bank small business loans include multiple SBA loan types, conventional term loans, quick loans, commercial real estate loans and equipment loans. The downside is that the lender only offers business loans in 28 states.\n\nUnlike most traditional banks, U.S. Bank offers a fast business loan of up to $250,000. While most banks take days or weeks to fund loans, U.S. Bank\u2019s Quick Loan can fund as quickly as the same day you apply.\n\nThe lender also offers an equipment loan online for up to $200,000 in financing without any down payment required. This makes an equipment loan through U.S. Bank an excellent option for businesses with minimal capital.\n\nU.S. Bank is an SBA Preferred Lender, offering SBA 7(a) loans, SBA 7(a) real estate loans and SBA 504 loans. Loan amounts can be as high as $5 million for both 7(a) loan types and up to $12.375 million for their 504 loans. As an SBA Preferred Lender, U.S. Bank also typically gives quicker approval than other SBA lenders.\n\nPros\n\nSBA Preferred Lender\n\nOnline application for some loan types\n\nCons\n\nMinimal eligibility requirements details\n\nInterest rates not provided for all loan types\n\nLimited state footprint\n\nHow to choose between Live Oak and U.S. Bank\n\nBoth Live Oak and U.S. Banks offer bank business loans that may be solid options depending on the small business owner\u2019s needs. Live Oak has a leg up on U.S. Bank as an SBA lender. But U.S. Bank offers one of the best equipment loans around.\n\nChoose Live Oak for SBA loans\n\nLive Oak offers the highest loan limits between the two lenders and offers long repayment terms. Live Oak gives out loans amounts up to $15 million on SBA loans, which is considerably higher than U.S. Bank\u2019s SBA loan limit of $12.375 million.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that interest rates, loan amounts and eligibility will differ for each business owner. Business owners with good or excellent credit scores will get the best interest rates on a loan. Certain businesses may not qualify for an SBA loan with Live Oak depending on income, time in business and other factors.\n\nChoose U.S. Bank for equipment loans\n\nU.S. Bank offers the most expansive equipment loan options. While Live Oak offers USDA loans that could be used to finance business equipment, only certain rural and agricultural businesses qualify for this loan type. U.S. Bank provides a specific loan for equipment with no industry restrictions.\n\nThe lender\u2019s equipment loan has multiple benefits to offer. Businesses can apply for up to $1 million in equipment financing. The loan can also be used to finance various pieces of equipment. Plus, equipment loans from U.S. Bank are secured by the equipment you purchase, so business owners don\u2019t have to offer any down payment for the loan.\n\nAlternatives\n\nWhen shopping for a business loan, looking at your options is a good idea. For example, a business credit card may be a better option for small equipment purchases since you can avoid interest payments if you pay your balance in full each month. And if you can\u2019t qualify for SBA 7(a) loans, other lenders offer different types of SBA loans beyond what either lender offers, including SBA microloans and Express Loans.\n\nBoth lenders likely require good-to-excellent credit and two or more years in business for approval. Other lenders specialize in helping business owners with bad credit and startups get approved for financing.\n\nBottom line\n\nBoth Live Oak and U.S. Bank offer several business loan options. As SBA Preferred Lenders, both can help you get SBA loans faster than other lenders. But Live Oak is far more experienced in providing SBA 7(a) loans and offers a few extra benefits to its borrowers. U.S. Bank gives the best option for equipment loans.\n\nRemember to look at multiple options before applying for a business loan. Consider your business needs and where you can get the most affordable deal on a loan.\n\nFrequently asked questions"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka says it has reached an agreement with China's EXIM Bank on debt, clearing IMF funding snag - Yahoo Finance", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:06:31 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Finance"}, "text": "FILE- A vendor counts currency notes as she sells vegetables at a market place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, June. 1, 2023.

IMF officials said the government needs to improve its tax administration, eliminate exemptions and crack down on tax evasion.\n\nSri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt \u2014 more than half of it to foreign creditors. Its economy was plunged into crisis, with severe shortages of food, fuel and other necessities. Strident public protests led to the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\nBorrowing for China-funded infrastructure projects like highways, an airport and seaport that did not attract expected business opportunities have added to the country's financial woes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe IMF agreed in March of this year to a $2.9 billion bailout package after receiving assurances from China that cleared a last hurdle in sealing an agreement. It released an initial $330 million in funding for Sri Lanka shortly afterward.\n\nThe government is negotiating with creditors to restructure its tens of billions of dollars in debt, aiming to reduce it by $17 billion.\n\nOver the past year, Sri Lanka\u2019s severe shortages of essentials like food, fuel and medicine have largely abated, and authorities have restored power supplies.\n\nBut public dissatisfaction has grown over the government\u2019s efforts to increase revenues by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses."}, {"title": "Bank of England considers changes to regulation of foreign bank ... - Reuters UK", "date": "Mon, 16 Oct 2023 15:56:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters UK"}, "text": "LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Monday it was thinking about possible changes to how it regulates branches of foreign banks, and flagged a likely easing in how it intends to apply global bank capital rules from mid-2025.\n\nThe operations of California-based Silicon Valley Bank in Britain had been treated as a branch for 10 years before being required to become a subsidiary, which made it easier to engineer a rapid takeover by HSBC after SVB's parent bank in the United States collapsed earlier this year.\n\nBoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods said the central bank is now thinking about its regulatory approach to branches, which are largely supervised by regulators in their home countries. Subsidiaries are directly regulated by the BoE and must hold their own capital cushions.\n\nLondon is a magnet for foreign bank branches, which Woods said was a key part of Britain's hosting of a competitive global financial centre.\n\n\"That is not going to change,\" Woods told the annual Mansion House dinner for the financial sector in London's City, adding that he would be considering \"targeted areas for improvement.\"\n\nThe experience with SVB UK raised an uncomfortable question for the BoE on how it decides a branch must convert to a subsidiary, based on level of deposits.\n\n\"Can we rely on our existing criteria on branch activities to spot and address other firms that might grow to resemble SVB UK?\" Woods said, adding that the focus would be on foreign branches that provide critical functions.\n\nBASEL FEEDBACK\n\nThe collapse of SVB and Credit Suisse, which was taken over by UBS earlier this year, raised questions about rules introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis to deal with failing lenders without taxpayer said.\n\n\"Without the post-crisis reforms, the failures of CS or SVB could have been the dominos that knocked over the entire global banking system,\" Woods said, adding there was more work to do to ensure banks can fail in a controlled, non-contagious manner.\n\nMore capital and liquidity would not necessarily be the answer to issues raised by this year's banking turmoil as the best rules would be useless without effective supervision and sustainable bank business models, Woods said.\n\nBritain, like the United States and Europe, is implementing the final leg of tougher \"Basel III\" capital rules introduced after the 2008 crisis.\n\nBanks have lobbied hard to dilute BoE proposals on Basel, and Woods said that following \"very clear feedback\" on issues like loans to small or unrated companies, he was confident \"we will be able to evolve them in a way that reflects legitimate concerns\".\n\nThe failure of SVB, a relatively small bank, will not stop the BoE from putting forward \"material simplifications\" to capital rules for small lenders, Woods said.\n\nReporting by Huw Jones Editing by William Schomberg and Paul Simao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "Deutsche Bank strategists recommend equity overweight into 2024 - Reuters", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:39:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters"}, "text": "Deutsche Bank logo is seen in this illustration taken March 12, 2023.

Perhaps it's one that needs no introduction, and this may be another reason to look upon the stock favorably. BAC offers the full package of products and services -- retail and commercial banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management solutions. In this article, I'll explain why I am bullish on Bank of America stock and why I think it could be a Buy this October and beyond.\n\nTo put it simply, Bank of America has an attractive valuation compared to its peers and the market. The company\u2019s stock is trading at lower multiples than the average for its peer group of banking companies and the S&P 500 Index (SPX). BAC also has strong fundamentals and growth prospects.\n\nI believe investors should consider adding Bank of America stock to their portfolios as the company continues to deliver on growth and profitability at a low valuation.\n\nWhy Things Look Good for the Long Term\n\nBank of America is one of the most attractive bank stocks for long-term investors, as it has several factors that set it apart from other banks. The first factor is its size and scale, which enable it to offer the widest range of financial products in the banking sector, it does, after all, have some $2.5 trillion in assets. The second factor is its financial strength, which is reflected in its high liquidity, capital, and regulatory ratios.\n\nAccording to the bank's press release regarding its stress test, Bank of America has ample liquidity from various global sources and a Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) ratio of 11.6% as of June 30, 2023, well above the minimum requirement of 9.5% that has been effective from October 1, 2023. The bank also announced that it will increase its CET1 requirement by another 0.5% starting in 2024, further enhancing its financial stability.\n\nAttractive Growth, Profitability, and Valuation\n\nGrowth\n\nBank of America has shown consistent growth in both the short and long term. In the past year, it managed to increase its revenue by 5.6%, its earnings per share (EPS) by 8.8%, and its return on equity by 60 basis points. It achieved this by expanding its customer base, improving its efficiency, and reducing its expenses.\n\nMoreover, Bank of America\u2019s growth has been even stronger in the past five years. It grew its revenue by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5%, its net income by 6.7%, and its EPS by 12.8%. These growth figures are impressive, especially for a large and mature company like Bank of America. It shows that the bank has been able to grow its revenue and net income steadily over the years while also increasing its EPS significantly by buying back shares and reducing its equity.\n\nProfitability\n\nLast quarter, Bank of America delivered impressive results. It reported an increase of 11% year-over-year in revenue, which reached $25.2 billion, while reporting a jump of 19% year-over-year in net income, which reached $7.4 billion. It has a high net margin of 29.3%, meaning that it keeps almost a third of its revenue as earnings.\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America has demonstrated high returns on its capital. It reported an 11.2% return on equity, which assesses how well the bank uses its shareholders\u2019 capital, and BAC sure does deploy capital efficiently. It reported a 15% return on tangible book value, which measures how well the bank generates profits from its tangible assets. These metrics are above the industry averages of 9% and 13%, respectively. Furthermore, Bank of America\u2019s profitability has been consistent over the past few years.\n\nValuation\n\nBank of America is currently undervalued by several measures. At today\u2019s prices, it trades at a low multiple of its earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow compared to its industry peers and to its intrinsic value. Specifically, it trades at the following multiples:\n\n7.7 times earnings, lower than the industry average of 8.8 times earnings; 2.2 times sales, lower than the industry average of 2.9 times sales; 0.81 times book value, lower than the industry average of 1.0 times book value; 4.6 times operating cash flow, lower than the industry average of 6.0 times operating cash flow.\n\nThese valuation ratios indicate that Bank of America is trading at a discount to its peers and to its intrinsic value. It also has a low price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.585. A low PEG ratio (under 1.0 is considered low) means that the stock is cheap relative to its expected growth rate. Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investors of all time, would likely be very excited to see such a behemoth of a company trading at such a low PEG ratio.\n\nIs BAC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, BAC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. At $34.40, the average BAC stock forecast implies 27.36% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nBank of America is a profitable, growing, and undervalued stock that deserves investors\u2019 attention. It has delivered strong results in its most recent quarter and over the past year. It has also shown consistent growth in both the short and long term while also increasing its shareholder value through buybacks and dividends.\n\nFurther, it trades at a low multiple of its earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow compared to its industry peers. Therefore, I believe that Bank of America is a good stock to consider for seeking a solid and stable bank stock with upside potential.\n\nDisclosure\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."}, {"title": "World Bank President on Ending Poverty on a Livable Planet - World Bank Group", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 17:17:50 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.worldbank.org", "title": "World Bank Group"}, "text": "\u201cTo create a world free of poverty \u2013 on a livable planet.\u201d\n\nThis vision and mission will test the sincerity of our ambition \u2013 it sets us on a journey that will require reimagined partnerships, a new way of working and thinking, an innovative plan to scale and replicate, additional resources, and optimism for what could be possible.\n\nIn all corners of the globe, people are eager to go to work, and to create with their own hands.

Gorman. Brian Davie, a former branch manager at Wells Fargo, used unauthorized cash withdrawals, money transfers, and cashier\u2019s checks to steal over $1 million. Davie targeted elderly and vulnerable customers. Eight victims have been identified. One woman had more than $566,000 stolen from her retirement accounts. Davie is scheduled for sentencing by U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle on January 2, 2024.\n\nDavie worked for Wells Fargo in Battle Ground from March of 2014 until he was fired in June 2019. According to records in the case, Davie used his position as a manager at the branch to conduct unauthorized transactions. Davie had access to customer files containing information about bank account balances. Davie hid his criminal activity by repeatedly exchanging cashier\u2019s checks until they were small enough to cash without triggering banking reporting requirements.\n\nDavie continued undetected because he stole from elderly customers who might be less likely to closely monitor their account balances. Some of Davie\u2019s victims had dementia or had limited English skills and did not understand banking transactions. In at least one case, Davie failed to file the paperwork to install a victim\u2019s relative as a co-signer on the victim\u2019s accounts.

I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen next in this crazy market.\n\nBut so many people talk about falling housing prices as if it would be a bad thing, like a repeat of the 2008 crash. I actually think housing prices falling would be a good thing.\n\nThink about it.\n\nTons of people have locked in ultra-low interest rates. Home equity is through the roof. Homeowners in this country have never had a bigger margin of safety for falling prices.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019d argue falling housing prices would be a boon to the economy. There is surely pent-up demand in the housing market from the millions of young millennials looking to settle down and buy a place of their own.\n\nIf prices were to fall, I believe you would see a huge upswing in homebuying activity.\n\nMore people would list. More people would buy. Inventory numbers would rise. And when there is activity in the housing market, people spend money. Lots of it \u2014 moving, furniture, decorations, lawncare, renovations, etc.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the housing market is if mortgage rates stay relatively high and housing prices refuse to fall.\n\nIn that case, affordability stays high and we have an entire generation of people who are either boxed out from ever owning a home or forced to pay an ever-increasing portion of their budget on a home.\n\nYou get into a situation of haves and have-nots in the housing market. The only ones who can afford are people who make a lot of money, already own a home or get help from their parents.\n\nPlus a huge part of the economy is basically benched.\n\nThat\u2019s unhealthy and unfair for young people who have done nothing wrong besides entering their prime household formation years during a terrible, no-good time to buy a home.\n\nThere is precedent for an unhealthy housing market becoming even unhealthier.\n\nCanada is a prime example I\u2019ve written about on this blog in recent months (here and here). Canadian home prices went crazy in the 2010s but then somehow found another gear and went to ludicrous levels in the 2020s.\n\nThis also happened the last time we had a large demographic enter their household formation years in the United States as well.\n\nThe 1970s were a horrible decade for financial assets. Stocks and bonds each technically showed gains on a nominal basis but lost money after accounting for inflation.\n\nHousing was the only financial asset that beat inflation on behalf of the middle class.1\n\nAccording to data from Robert Shiller, national housing prices were up nearly 130% in the 1970s. Even after accounting for sky-high inflation that decade, housing prices were up double-digits on a real basis.\n\nThe problem for homebuyers is mortgage rates were rising too:\n\nFor a 30 year fixed rate mortgage, the lowest borrowing rate was a little more than 7%. By the end of the 1970s you were looking at 12% mortgages. As Paul Volcker\u2019s Fed tried to snuff out inflation, mortgage rates topped out at nearly 19% by 1981.\n\nSure, housing prices were much lower back then but affordability in monthly payments in the early-1980s experienced a similar spike as what we\u2019ve witnessed today, through a combination of both rising housing prices and an insane spike in borrowing rates.\n\nThe problem for homebuyers back then, much like today, is housing prices refused to come down. Here\u2019s a look at housing price growth in the 1970s and 1980s:\n\nYes, things were more muted on an inflation-adjusted basis but the combination of ever-rising prices coupled with double-digit mortgage rates couldn\u2019t have been easy to stomach.\n\nHousing prices took a little breather in the early-1980s until mortgage rates finally came back down a bit but it\u2019s not like you saw falling prices even after mortgage rates went into the stratosphere.\n\nNo two economic or market environments are ever the same but a similar dynamic playing out in the housing market today is the nightmare scenario.\n\nIt would be far healthier if we did see prices fall to spur housing activity and offer some relief to buyers who have been priced out of the housing market.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the housing market is not a drop in prices.\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the housing market is a continuation of the current environment where owning a home becomes unaffordable for a larger and larger subset of the population through no fault of their own.\n\nPeople who already own their homes would be happy to see prices continue going up but it would be more beneficial to the economy and make for a healthier housing market in the long run if prices went down a little.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nWhere the Housing Bubbles Are\n\n1Gold was far and away the best-performing asset in the 1970s but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 it was basically impossible for regular investors to buy gold back then unless they wanted to store gold bars in a safe.

The US bond market is losing its strategic footing, whether in economics, policy, or technical aspects.\n\nThere are readily available short-term explanations for the rollercoaster ride in yields that has garnered significant attention in the US and beyond. Early in the week, dovish statements by several Fed officials influenced market sentiment by indicating the possibility of no further interest rate hikes as the market had been doing the heavy lifting for them. Geopolitical concerns reinforced the yield movements. Bonds rallied sharply with yields falling.\n\nMidweek, the focus shifted to inflation data, including certain measures that came in hotter than expected at both the producer and consumer levels. On Friday, geopolitical worries resurfaced as the market feared an escalation of the tragic conflict in the Middle East. On Thursday alone, the 10-year Treasury yield swung nearly 0.2 percentage points between an intraday high and low.\n\nBut my primary concern lies elsewhere: the most influential segment of the world\u2019s financial markets is losing its longer-term strategic anchors and is at risk of losing its short-term stabiliser ones as well.\n\nThe recent consensus on economic growth for the world\u2019s largest economy has been erratic, with forecasts fluctuating between a soft and a hard landing with the occasional mention of crash and no landings as well. Expectations about the Fed\u2019s actions have similarly fluctuated, from potential rate cuts in the near term to maintaining higher rates for a longer period.\n\nFederal Reserve policy is further shrouded in uncertainty, with questions over what the equilibrium level of interest rates should be, the delayed effects of a concentrated cycle of rate rises, the impact of a shrinking balance sheet and the absence of an effective framework for monetary policy.\n\nAll of this occurs in a context of substantial fiscal deficits that show no signs of significant moderation, for reasons that include Congressional dysfunction and the considerable bills associated with past promises and ongoing transitions in response to critical challenges such as climate change. Consequently, the balance of risks suggests more significant fiscal pressures than originally anticipated.\n\nThis uncertainty also extends to longer-term supply and demand dynamics. Despite rising interest rates, there is genuine doubt about who will readily absorb the additional supply of government debt associated with high deficits. The Fed, which was the most reliable buyer for over a decade with a seemingly limitless printing press and little price sensitivity, is now selling bonds, reversing its quantitative easing programmes since the financial crisis with quantitative tightening.\n\nForeign buyers seem more hesitant, including for geopolitical reasons. A significant portion of the large domestic institutional investor base, such as pension funds and insurance companies, already holds substantial quantities of bonds at large mark-to-market losses. Additionally, concerns about the stability of regional bank deposits persist, possibly leading them to sell bonds if deposits decrease.\n\nFortunately, the bond market still possesses some short-term stabilisers, which have mitigated even more extreme daily fluctuations. Sudden surges in yields attract buyers seeking greater certainty to lock in higher income for the long term, while sudden drops in yields translate into higher prices, allowing some overexposed investors to lighten up on any holdings where they are sitting on paper losses.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that their resilience should not be taken for granted. No matter how you look at it, the world\u2019s most crucial benchmark market is on an unpredictable journey with an uncertain destination.\n\nI recall during the transition I made approximately 25 years ago from the public to the private sector when I was cautioned by a bond trader that there would be moments when technical factors would override fundamentals, resulting in price volatility that could potentially destabilise both the financial markets and the broader economy. He was applying this good old-fashioned \u201ctail wagging the dog\u201d phenomenon to emerging markets. Without a more concerted effort to reestablish key anchors, it seems that this warning needs to be taken more seriously in the most systemic segment of mature markets."}, {"title": "Housing Market Update: Listings Tick Up, But Buyers Back Off - Redfin News", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 09:23:03 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.redfin.com", "title": "Redfin News"}, "text": "As a data journalist at Redfin, Dana Anderson writes about the numbers behind real estate trends.

Accel, in its annual Euroscape report, said the share price values of big technology firms such as Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia rose by an average of 36% year over year. Nvidia joined the trillion-dollar club for the first time, with the U.S. chip giant now worth over $1 trillion. Nvidia's high-performance chips power many advanced generative AI models, which produce new content from huge volumes of training data.\n\nThe world's biggest technology companies added $2.4 trillion to their market capitalizations in 2023, according to Accel data. Accel\n\nAccel's Euroscape index, which includes massive cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) names such as Salesforce , Palantir and Unity, rose 29% in the year to date.\n\nThe Euroscape index, which tracks several publicly-listed cloud stocks, is up 29% year-to-date, according to Accel. Accel\n\nLast year, the picture for cloud and SaaS was grim. Companies saw $1.6 trillion wiped off their value as investors rotated out of high-growth tech stocks, according to Accel. Now, there are signs the pressure is easing.\n\nFaster recovery than after dotcom bust\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite returned to 80% of its all-time high within 18 months, according to Accel, marking a faster bounce back than than after the dotcom bust in the 1990s.\n\nThe Nasdaq recovered 80% of its all-time high within 18 months. Accel\n\nIt took the Nasdaq around 14 years to reach that milestone, Accel said.\n\nIt took the Nasdaq Composite 14 years to recover 80% of its 2000 peak. Accel\n\nPublic multiples for Euroscape companies are also back to a 10-year pre-Covid average of 6.1-times next-twelve-months revenue. Funding for cloud and SaaS companies in Europe, Israel and the U.S. has also reverted to pre-Covid levels.\n\nPublic SaaS and cloud company multiples have reverted back to their 10-year, pre-Covid average, according to Accel. Accel\n\n\"We are in a very different time than 2000,\" Botteri told CNBC. \"If you look back at 2000, it really took a long time \u2026 for the Nasdaq to get back to 80% of its peak. And now, after the 2021 reset, it only took 18 months to get there.\"\n\nThe year of AI\n\nAI was the primary technology driving the performance of cloud and SaaS in 2023, according to Accel \u2014 and it's not difficult to see why. The world has been abuzz with talk about generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard and Anthropic's Claude. \"Generative AI is something that is really redefining software,\" Philippe Botteri, partner at Accel, told CNBC on a call Friday. \"Any software company is leveraging generative AI, whether they're just a startup or a new company or an existing company ... You should really think about this as something that is pervasive.\" The U.S. led the way in generative AI funding deals, with the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic raising billions. OpenAI raised the biggest sum \u2014 $10 billion \u2014 and Inflection came second with $1.3 billion raised.\n\nThe number of new unicorns created in 2023 has reverted back to pre-Covid levels \u2014 however, AI is a bright spot with a majority of the unicorns now generative AI companies. Accel\n\nIn Europe, three of the biggest generative AI company rounds came out of France \u2014 Hugging Face ($235 million), Poolside ($126 million) and Mistral AI ($113 million). The number of unicorn companies reverted to pre-Covid levels, with AI taking up a much greater proportion of new billion-dollar companies. In Europe and Israel, 40% of new unicorns were in generative AI; in the United States, it was 80%.\n\nShifting focus to profitability\n\nThis year has been a tough one for tech, with fundraising and valuations dropping sharply as investors grew wary of the sector. Tech companies tend to prioritize growth and expansion over short-term profits. But investors have been shifting money away from high-growth bets amid higher interest rates, which make the cost of capital more expensive. Accordingly, the growth rates of Euroscape companies fell from an average of 68% in the first quarter of 2021 to 23% in the second quarter of 2023. Free cash flow increased on average from -9% to +5% in the same period.\n\nBig Tech takes a beating\n\nThis year, deal-making activity from tech giants hit a snag as regulators clamped down on those firms over concerns that they'd become too large. There were only 10 transactions involving a Big Tech company this year, Accel noted. That's down sharply from prior years. In 2021, acquisitions led by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) hit 27, and in 2022 there were 26 Big Tech deals.\n\nThe number of Big Tech-led acquisitions declined sharply in 2023 \u2014 down from 26 last year.

Risks to financial stability are not meaningful at this point owing to DeFi\u2019s small size but require monitoring. In addition, DeFi\u2019s unique features have led to new market manipulation issues that need to be addressed.\n\nDeFi has seen significant development over the last few years, although it remains very small in size (the Total Value Locked in DeFi protocols reached USD 45bn as of end-June 2023 representing less than 4% of the total crypto-assets market capitalisation), and has garnered attention from consumers, but also from global regulators because of the risks it raises.\n\nDeFi: categorisation of smart contracts\n\nThe article introduces a methodology for the categorisation of smart contracts which leverages on the latter\u2019s source code and on topic modelling. It explores the rate of deployment of smart contracts belonging to the identified categories over time, contributing to an enhanced and nuanced understanding of DeFi,and also to identifying related significant risks.\n\nESMA defines five major smart contract categories and monitors their relative incidence over time. It notes a significant difference in terms of heterogeneity between the first and the second surge in smart contract deployment (occurring in 2017 \u2013 2018 and in 2021 \u2013 2023, respectively), reflecting the adoption of increasingly complex and interdependent protocols that have come to characterise DeFi.\n\nWebinar\n\nESMA is organising a public webinar on the findings of these articles.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Technical and seasonal indicators that investors use to gauge the U.S. stock market's health show it may be time to buy, though upcoming inflation data and the third-quarter earnings season could still throw Wall Street a curveball.\n\nThe S&P 500 has slid about 5% since reaching its late-July high, but so far this month the benchmark index has rebounded. Technical analysts see a case for the rally to continue, pointing to indicators showing stocks may be oversold and historical evidence showing year-end is typically a strong period for equities.\n\nThere remain plenty of reasons for caution. Some analysts are concerned that a small group of megacap stocks has led the S&P 500\u2019s gains this year, muddying the case for a sustained rally in the broader market.\n\nInvestors are also worried about the Federal Reserve interest rate trajectory, which could be influenced by Thursday\u2019s U.S. consumer price report. Another wild card could be third-quarter earnings season which kicks off on Friday and should help show whether companies can justify valuations that have swelled this year.\n\n\"The preponderance of evidence supports the case for a year end rally,\" said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. However, he said, \"it remains to be seen if the market has begun a multi-month topping process.\"\n\nAnalysts were encouraged by the positive reaction from stocks in the face of both a surge in monthly jobs that raised concerns about a still too-hot economy, and the deadly attacks in the Middle East.\n\nThe S&P 500's ability to rise in the aftermath of those events \"leads me to believe that a lot of negative information had been priced into the market,\" Clissold said.\n\nOne positive sign is that the S&P 500 has remained above the closely watched 200-day moving average, a trend line that can act as support. The S&P 500 was last about 3.5% above its 200-day moving average.\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, pointed out that the index remained above the 200-day moving average while more than one-fifth of the index's stocks were in an oversold status, in which relative strength readings indicate a positive price correction could be coming.\n\nThose two factors have occurred together only 14 times since 1990. In 12 of those times the S&P 500 was higher six months later, Turnquist said.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nStocks have tended to perform well at year end -- with November and December logging the second and third-biggest average S&P 500 monthly gains -- though this year the trends may portend even more favorably.\n\nIn the 14 instances when the S&P 500 has gained at least 10% through July and then declined in August, as it did this year, the index has increased every time over the last four months of the year, according to Ned Davis Research. The average gain in those instances has been 10%.\n\nMarket sentiment has turned more negative with the latest stock slide, with 41.6% of investors bearish and 30.1% bullish in the latest American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) weekly survey.\n\nBut rising bearish sentiment often works as a contrary indicator for stocks, suggesting plenty of investors are on the sidelines who could buy on positive developments.\n\nYet the picture is not as clear cut as last year, when a brutal market selloff saw stocks fall to a nearly two-year low in mid-October. That was followed by a 28% rally in the S&P 500 through late July of this year.\n\nIndicators such as the AAII do not yet suggest the pessimistic sentiment is \"excessive\", which would be more clear if the spread between bulls and bears was wider, according to Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Hi Mount Research.\n\nFor example, bearish sentiment stood at 56% in the AAII survey last October.\n\nFurther, notes Delwiche, stock market breadth has been weak. The combined weekly number of new 52-week lows on the NYSE and Nasdaq has topped the amount of new 52-week highs for nine straight weeks, he said.\n\nEven if the market rebounds in the near term, Delwiche said, \"if you don\u2019t have that regime shift where you get back to more stocks making new highs than new lows, then it's an oversold bounce that doesn\u2019t go anywhere.\"\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nReporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "'Very unpredictable': Bay Area housing market facing uncertainty - SFGATE", "date": "Mon, 16 Oct 2023 11:03:22 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.sfgate.com", "title": "SFGATE"}, "text": "FILE: A \"for sale\" sign is posted in front of a home that is listed for over $1 million on April 29, 2022, in San Francisco.

But this week's decline has also come as the country's central bank put $30 billion of its reserves on the line to support the shekel.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\n5/LOCAL IMPACT\n\nAnother clear sign of stress in Israel's markets has been a huge spike in the cost of insuring its government debt using what are known as credit default swaps (CDS).\n\nInvestors use CDS either as a protection tool or to speculate and this week the cost of buying Israel CDS has surged 80%.\n\nOn top of that, Moody's is scheduled to review Israel's 'A1' credit rating late on Friday. The country has never been downgraded by any of the three major rating agencies - S&P, Moody's and Fitch - but the rise in CDS means that it now costs the same to insure Israel exposure as it does for India, which is five rating levels below Israel on the lowest rung of 'investment grade'.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nReporting by Marc Jones Additonal reporting Canan Sevgili Editing by Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"title": "Potential end of biggest bond bear market ever has some investors ... - CNBC", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:49:58 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnbc.com", "title": "CNBC"}, "text": "Kim Forrest has long considered herself a staunch proponent of stocks. Lately, however, she's been giving more thought to a more staid part of markets: fixed income. \"You kind of get the math of this and you go, 'Hey, if we think we're at peak interest rates for this cycle, it might be time to buy some bonds,'\" said Forrest, founder of Bokeh Capital Partners. \"Oddly enough, even though ... God knows I'm an equity girl, I'm thinking bonds. Bonds could be a good thing.\" Bonds are starting to make a lot of sense for investors, Forrest said. Treasurys have lost half their value from their peak, according to Bank of America. And, last week, the 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level in 16 years. Even after pulling back somewhat from those levels, the benchmark yield remains within striking distance of the key 5% threshold. Forrest isn't alone in her thinking that now might be an attractive entry point for bonds. The potential unwinding of what BofA recently called the \"greatest bond bear market in history\" has more investors trying to lock in higher yields ahead of potential rate cuts next year from the Federal Reserve. 'A lot for us to love bonds' Other investors are building out their bond exposure. Nancy Tengler, investment chief at Laffer Tengler Investments, said her team started adding bonds last summer after getting out in August 2020. She's been building \"very short ladders\" for her clients \u2014 buying 3-month, 6-month and even 9-month Treasurys \u2014 to take advantage of the near-term peak in the yield curve. \"We have clients who have income needs, and this is a pretty attractive time to own the short end of the curve,\" Tengler said. Meanwhile, Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, said he is extending the duration of maturities for the bonds he's buying to try to lock in yields for longer. He said he's trying to stay in higher quality bonds at the longer end of the curve. Elsewhere, Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" this week that she's bullish on bonds for the first time in years. \"I've been doing this job for about a decade now,\" Roland said. \"This is actually the first time that we've been overweight bonds in portfolios. It takes a lot for us to love bonds.\" To be sure, Roland is not sure how much longer bonds will remain attractive. In fact, she expects she will go back to being overweight stocks in time after the downshift in yields plays out, saying equities remain a \"much more powerful compounder of wealth over time.\" However, fixed income strategists say that bonds will continue to remain attractive as the U.S. is unlikely to have rates held near zero as it had over the prior decade. \"We don't think that we're gonna go back to the low-interest rate environment that we just came out of. So we don't we don't think that it necessarily has to be a trade off necessarily between stocks and bonds,\" said Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income strategist at LPL Financial. \"We think both are viable asset classes again.\" Investor plays For those interested in adding exposure, Bokeh Capital's Forrest recommends investors skim maybe 10% to 20% of their equity exposure into government bonds or high quality corporate debt. Meanwhile, Sit Investment's Doty and LPL Financial's Gillum said individual core bond funds and ETFs that track the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index would be a good place to start. Gillum also recommends ladder portfolios to navigate the current interest rate volatility in markets. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) is down by more than 11% this year, but higher by more than 4% just this week. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) is off by more than 2% in 2023, but greater than 1% on the week. Separately, Sit's Doty thinks investors with a greater risk tolerance should also add some exposure to high yield bonds \u2014 about a 5% allocation \u2014 saying the risks are likely mitigated after September's blockbuster jobs report continued to show a resilient economy. Corporations that issue high-yield bonds generally have lower credit quality, meaning they could have greater levels of debt that put them at risk in an uncertain macro environment. \"If you have large-cap equities, I think it'd make a lot of sense to move a piece of that into high yield and investment grade bonds,\" Doty added. \"And you'll end up with a more stable portfolio without really giving up much return. In fact, you might even be enhancing your return.\" Looming risks Of course, there are risks ahead that could drive yields higher, meaning prices could drop for investors. One possible \"wildcard\" on the horizon is a potential shutdown if the government fails to agree on a spending bill by the Nov. 17 deadline, Doty said. Depending on how markets take the news, that could potentially drive a selloff in bonds, he said. Still, Doty expects the risk is skewed to the downside. Notably, he expects the breakout of the Hamas-Israel conflict over the weekend that spurred a flight to safety into Treasurys could mean near-term peak is in for yields. Before this weekend, Doty said he expected the 10-year yield would top 5%. On Wednesday, four days after the start of the war, the benchmark yield hit 4.544%, or its lowest level since last month. \"So a year from now, I can't imagine the Fed not having cut rates,\" Doty said. \"And it just seems like yields will be lower across the board.\""}, {"title": "Why Treasurys could give the U.S. stock market a green light for a year-end rally - MarketWatch", "date": "Sat, 14 Oct 2023 17:22:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.marketwatch.com", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "text": "The volatility in the world\u2019s biggest bond market in recent weeks has been too much for U.S. stocks to handle as investors come to terms with the likelihood that interest rates will remain high deep into 2024 until underlying inflationary pressures ease.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury market, the bedrock of the global financial system, has been hammered by repeated selling since late September, sending the yields on the 10-year and 30-year Treasurys to levels last seen when the economy was moving toward the financial crisis in 200, before yields fell again in the past week.\n\nBack in September a bond market selloff was fueled by a hawkish outlook from the Federal Reserve, along with mounting concern about the U.S. fiscal deficit and federal debt amid the potential for a government shutdown if a budget for the 2024 fiscal year is not settled by mid-November.\n\nEarlier this week though, increased uncertainty about the conflict in the Middle East propelled demand for safer assets and caused longer-term bond prices to jump and their yields to fall.\n\nThen, on Thursday, a Treasury bond auction which saw a pullback in demand despite notably higher yields, sent longer-term rates higher again while investors were already digesting inflation data that showed consumer prices remained elevated in September. The U.S. stocks fell and booked their worst day in five sessions on Thursday.\n\nInvestors are now wondering what it will take for interest rates and bond yields to fall in the months ahead and whether a retreat in yields could eventually push stocks higher to rally into the year-end.\n\nTim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, said \u201cexcessive pessimism\u201d in the bond market is setting up for a relief rally both in stock and bond prices as \u201cthere\u2019s not as much inflationary pressures as the market has been pricing in,\u201d he told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Thursday.\n\nHayes said his team found the bond sentiment data has started to reflect a \u201cdecisive reversal\u201d away from too much pessimism in the Treasury market which could send bond yields lower and boost equities given the inverse correlations between the S&P 500 SPX and the 10-year Treasury note yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y.\n\nSee: Here is what needs to happen for the S&P 500 to hold on to this year\u2019s gains\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts said disinflation may not be enough for the Federal Reserve to drop its \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d interest rate narrative which was primarily responsible for the big spike in yields since September.\n\nThe economy needs a slowdown in the consumer sector for some relaxation in the Fed\u2019s \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d narrative and to maybe push policymakers to adopt a more flexible outlook for its long-term guidance, said Thierry Wizman, global FX and interest rates strategist at Macquarie.\n\n\u201cOf course, the Fed right now is certainly not saying anything that\u2019s remotely suggestive of \u2018high-for-long\u2019 being taken away or being removed or negated, so I don\u2019t expect yields to fall a lot unless we start to get reasons to believe the Fed is going to remove that narrative based on the economic data,\u201d Wizman told MarketWatch via phone.\n\nHowever, Wizman said he is confident that the U.S. consumption data will weaken over the next few months when major consumer-product and -service companies start to provide guidance for the fourth quarter, and when U.S. consumers, which have been trapped in a web of conflicting signals on the health of the economy, open their wallet for the holiday shopping season.\n\n\u201cThis will produce some weakness on the consumer side of the market and there\u2019s no doubt the slowdown will be more pronounced than most people expect in the economy, [but] that will be the positive scenario for bonds,\u201d said Marco Pirondini, head of U.S. equities at Amundi U.S., in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nHowever, that also means investors should not be \u201ctoo anxious to buy dips in the stock market\u201d because it would be very unusual if the stock market doesn\u2019t see \u201cmultiple compression\u201d with Treasury yields at 16-year highs, Wizman said. \u201cStocks would still look too rich even if the Fed drops the \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 narrative in the first quarter of 2024.\u201d\n\nSee: Fed skips rate hike for now, but doesn\u2019t rule out another increase this year\n\nThe \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d mantra is an idea Fed officials have tried to get the market to absorb in recent months, with Fed Chair Powell hardening his rhetoric at the September FOMC meeting, pointing potentially to more rate hikes or, more importantly, interest rates that stay higher for longer.\n\nFed officials saw interest rates coming down to 5.1% in 2024, higher than June\u2019s outlook for rates to finish next year at 4.6%, according to the latest Summary of Economic Projections at the September policy meeting.\n\nSee: Stock-market moves show bond traders are still in charge as yields renew rise\n\nHowever, Wizman characterized the \u201chigher-than-longer\u201d narrative as a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d as he thought Fed officials simply wanted to signal to the market that they were frustrated that financial conditions hadn\u2019t measurably tightened enough in 2023, so they utilized the narrative to get rising Treasury yields to do some of the \u201cheavy lifting.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 Fed officials are not really serious about \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 \u2013 they just did it to drive long-term yields higher for now,\u201d he added.\n\nIf a slowdown in the consumer sector of the economy and ongoing disinflation are powerful enough to sap Fed\u2019s rate expectations, Treasury yields could continue to decline without having to have a calamity or big recession in the U.S. economy to drive investors back to the safe-haven assets like Treasurys, strategists said.\n\nSee: U.S. stock-market seasonality suggests a potential rally in the fourth quarter. Why this time might be different.\n\nMeanwhile, stock-market seasonality may also help lift sentiment. Historically, the fourth quarter has been the best quarter for the U.S. stock market, with the large-cap S&P 500 index up nearly 80% of the time dating back to 1950 and gaining more than 4% on average.\n\nThe S&P 500 has risen 0.9% so far in the fourth quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP has advanced 1.4% in October, according to FactSet data.\n\n\u201cSo you have this situation where sentiment got stretched and now sentiment is reversing with more confidence that bond yields have reached their peak, so equities can rally moving into the end of the year, and that should start to become increasingly evident,\u201d said Hayes.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 8.2 basis points to 4.628% on Friday, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y declined by 9.2 basis points to 4.777%.

In other words, is a stock market rally being driven by only a handful of the largest companies, or is the majority S&P 500 companies also moving higher amid a broader market rally?\n\nAccording to Wilson, right now it's the former and not the latter, and that's a bearish setup for a year-end stock market rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The average stock has already broken down technically... the signals are weaker and suggest key tactical support is vulnerable,\" Wilson said.\n\nAnd stocks that screen for defensive criteria like low leverage, high free cash flows, and low volatility are some of the best performers in the market right now, which suggests \"a cautious tone under the surface of the market,\" Wilson highlighted.\n\nOther bearish factors that could weigh down stocks into the end of the year include a decline in earnings revisions among Wall Street analysts.\n\n\"Earnings revisions breadth for the overall S&P 500 has fallen sharply over the last couple of weeks (the most significant 2-week decline since July 2022),\" Wilson said, adding that rosy projections for 12% profit growth in 2024 could be revised lower as third-quarter earnings season gets underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we see revisions underperform seasonality over the coming weeks and continue to decline, it would be a sign that other cyclical risks including macro headwinds are driving the earnings revisions backdrop,\" Wilson said.\n\nFinally, consumer confidence is on the decline as both prices and interest rates remain elevated. According to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, consumers' assessment of their own personal finances fell by a marked 15%.\n\nAltogether, this gives Wilson confidence that his year-end S&P 500 price target of 3,900 is within reach.\n\n\"The bottom line, the breakdown in various breadth measures, cautious factor leadership, the recent decline in earnings revisions and fading consumer confidence reduce the odds of a fourth-quarter rally,\" Wilson said."}, {"title": "Leon Cooperman expects very little from the market and is only interested in individual stocks - CNBC", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 19:23:16 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnbc.com", "title": "CNBC"}, "text": "Leon Cooperman at the 2019 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 19, 2019.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman said he remains a bear with little interest in the broader stock market, partly because it's underestimating the risk of a fiscal crisis.\n\n\"I'm of the view that we borrow from the future with very profligate fiscal policy,\" Cooperman said at CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit. \"Ultimately, we will have a crisis in public sector finance, and the market is not discounting a crisis.

While the NCX program was easy for Mississippi timber owners to participate in, it has gone away with no similar replacement program available.\n\n\u201cThere are two types of carbon markets: voluntary and involuntary or compliance,\u201d VanderSchaaf said. \u201cNCX and a couple of others are voluntary, meaning the buyer is choosing to participate, not mandated or regulated by law to purchase.\n\n\u201cA compliance market is a cap and trade. That\u2019s where a government agency caps the amount of emissions an industry can emit. If businesses exceed the amount allocated to them -- the cap -- they either have to \u2018trade\u2019 for credits from another business in the industry that is using less than their allocated amount, or purchase offsets from somebody else, such as a forest landowner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe goal of these efforts is that industries reduce the global impact of greenhouses gases, which are harmful to the environment.\n\nAlthough the one-year harvest deferral program NCX offered is gone, other options are available. However, it is more difficult now for those who own small acreage or who want short-term contracts.\n\n\u201cIndustries that have to offset their emissions by law need to have a steady supply of that carbon offset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would rather purchase from a large landowner or from an aggregator who has organized participating smaller landowners to offer a large supply of long-term carbon offsets.\u201d\n\nThese long-term contracts can be up to 100 years, although some markets have terms as short as 20 or 40 years with requirements as to minimum acreage and harvests.\n\n\u201cNCX was directed toward forest landowners in the Southeast. Most of the other programs are geared toward the West or Northeast,\u201d VanderSchaaf said. \u201cBecause of the long-term contracts and the steady supply of carbon offsets or credits, these contracts pay more.\u201d\n\nJessie Purvis, a landowner in Rankin County, participated in the NCX program in 2021 and 2022 after extensively researching to determine any risks involved or long-term penalties. He was skeptical going into the program.\n\n\u201cTrees and many other natural resources already capture carbon and are readily renewable, so exactly why is a payment due for something that already exists?\u201d he asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be for a new carbon capture operation? I\u2019ve seen some of the same things happen in the past, and while they make great headlines and put money in pockets of well-connected individuals and businesses, many times they don\u2019t really do what they are promoted to do.\u201d\n\nThrough NCX, Purvis received just over $14 an acre for his one-year harvest deferral on enrolled timberland.\n\n\u201cBased on a one-year operation, losing the NCX program reduces the income from this tree farm by $10-$20 per acre per year while still growing timber,\u201d Purvis said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything about how I will operate the property overall.\u201d\n\nPurvis said he could possibly participate in a few other carbon credit programs, but doing so would tie up his land and prevent harvests for decades.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan to do anything that ties me or the land up like that,\u201d Purvis said. \u201cMy plans may change, the land uses may need to change, health and financial needs change; therefore, I am unwilling to commit to any long-term deal.\u201d\n\nFor more information on forestry, carbon markets and more, visit MSU Extension at <a href=\"http://extension.msstate.edu/natural-resources/forestry\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">http://extension.msstate.edu/natural-resources/forestry</span></a>."}, {"title": "China\u2019s CATL, BYD Dominate EV Battery Market - Transport Topics", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 13:35:31 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.ttnews.com", "title": "Transport Topics"}, "text": "China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. ranked No. 1, with a 37% share of the market worldwide.

In this post, we take a closer look at who is currently trading in the federal funds market, as well as the reasons for their participation.\n\nThe Fed Funds Market\n\nThe federal funds (or fed funds) market enables depository institutions to directly trade central bank reserves in the U.S. In this market, depository institutions and other financial entities\u2014mainly government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)\u2014borrow and lend funds on an uncollateralized basis, typically with overnight maturity. The fed funds market is key for monetary policy implementation and has historically played an important role in the redistribution of reserves across the banking system. Prior to 2008, reserves were in the tens of billions of dollars and the fed funds market was very active, with participants consistently borrowing, lending, and intermediating throughout the day to meet their statutory reserve requirements. Effective October 1, 2008, Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay depository institutions interest on their reserve balances. In addition, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet to support the U.S. economy\u2014first during the global financial crisis and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014leading to reserves reaching $4 trillion in late 2021, as discussed in this post. In this new environment, the need to actively borrow in the fed funds market has waned. Daily trading volume dropped from around $150-$175 billion, or around 2 percent of commercial bank assets, prior to 2008 (as estimated in this post) to around $60-$80 billion per day in the 2010s, increasing to an average of $110 billion, or 0.5 percent of bank assets, per day in 2023.\n\nWith reserves elevated in the banking system, who is now borrowing and lending in the fed funds market? And why?\n\nBorrowers in the Fed Funds Market\n\nAs the chart below shows, the main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches). Since 2016, FBO branches have borrowed around $45-$110 billion per day, representing between 65 and 95 percent of the total daily volume in the fed funds market. FBO branches are the most common structure of foreign banking in the U.S., and they generally engage in activities similar to those of domestic banks.\n\nFBO Branches Are the Main Borrowers in the Fed Funds Market\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Form FR 2420, Report of Selected Money Market Rates; authors\u2019 calculations.\n\nNote: The chart shows quarterly average federal funds volume by borrower type from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2023.\n\nUnlike domestic banks, however, most FBO branches are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) after amendments to the International Banking Act disallowed new branches of FBOs from obtaining deposit insurance. This regulatory difference has two important implications for why FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market: First, it limits their access to deposits\u2014the main source of domestic bank funding\u2014making fed funds an important source of their short-term funding. Second, since they do not pay the FDIC assessment fee, most FBO branches face an effective cost of borrowing fed funds that is lower than that of domestic banks. Lower funding costs give FBO branches an advantage over their domestic counterparts in arbitraging fed funds offered at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate, as they can effectively earn a larger spread by borrowing fed funds and depositing the borrowed funds at the Fed. Furthermore, differences in regulatory requirements across jurisdictions make engaging in the arbitrage trade less costly and less capital intensive for FBO branches. Specifically, leverage ratios in foreign jurisdictions are often calculated as a period-end snapshot, as opposed to daily or weekly averages in the U.S., which allows FBO branches more flexibility to borrow between reporting dates and simply unwind their positions on month-end or quarter-end dates to maintain higher reported leverage ratios.\n\nThe chart above shows that domestic banks are also borrowers in the fed funds market. Borrowing by domestic banks ranged from $2.5 billion in late 2021 to $25 billion in mid-2019, representing between 5 and 35 percent, respectively, of the total daily volume of fed funds traded.\n\nAs shown in the next chart, their borrowing increases when aggregate reserves decline. This finding is consistent with results from the November 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS), where more than 70 percent of domestic banks responded that they were likely or very likely to borrow in unsecured funding markets\u2014including the fed funds market\u2014as a way to build liquidity if their level of reserve balances were to fall below a minimum threshold (see this summary of the SFOS results).\n\nFed Funds Borrowing Increases as Aggregate Reserves Decline\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED database; authors\u2019 calculations.\n\nNote: Reserves figures are quarterly averages.\n\nWho\u2019s Lending in the Fed Funds Market?\n\nFederal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) are the top lenders in the fed funds market. The FHLBs are GSEs that support mortgage lending and community investments and are organized as cooperatives owned by their members. The eleven FHLBs raise funds in global markets through the sale of debt securities that they then lend to their members through collateralized loans (called \u201cadvances\u201d), which represent around two-thirds of their total assets (see the FHLB financial reports). As the next chart shows, GSEs dominate lending in the fed funds market and are responsible for more than 90 percent of the total daily volume of fed funds traded.\n\nFHLBs Are the Main Lenders in the Fed Funds Market\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Form FR 2420, Report of Selected Money Market Rates; authors\u2019 calculations.\n\nNote: The chart shows quarterly average federal funds volume by lender type from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTwo primary factors contribute to FHLBs\u2019 willingness to lend in the fed funds market. First, FHLBs must hold liquidity portfolios\u2014partly to meet minimum regulatory requirements, but also to satisfy advances to their members. Fed funds are key instruments in such portfolios, along with interest-bearing deposit accounts and other selected short-term investments such as reverse repos. This means that FHLBs turn to the fed funds market to invest excess cash holdings. Second, unlike domestic banks and FBO branches, FHLBs do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, which creates an incentive for them to lend at rates below the IORB rate. In turn, this incentive to lend at low rates triggers the arbitrage mechanism between fed funds rates and the IORB rate, making it a regular phenomenon rather than an anomaly.\n\nTwo additional points are noteworthy here. First, since FHLBs have access to the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility that the Fed introduced in 2013, they are unwilling to lend at rates below the ON RRP rate. Second, since FHLBs face counterparty credit limits, the aggregate volume lent to a single counterparty is often limited (see here for details on these limits), which favors that a nontrivial arbitrage spread usually prevails.\n\nThe chart above shows that domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market, but at very small volumes. This is due to their ability to earn the IORB rate, which disincentivizes them from lending reserves in the fed funds market when the clearing rate is below IORB.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe fed funds market has changed dramatically since 2008: The Fed expanded its balance sheet to support the U.S. economy, resulting in reserves in the banking system increasing substantially, and it also began paying interest on these reserve balances. Daily volume in the fed funds market has decreased substantially and market dynamics have evolved to capture arbitrage activity between FHLBs and branches of foreign banks.\n\nHow to cite this post:\n\nGara Afonso, Gonzalo Cisternas, Brian Gowen, Jason Miu, and Joshua Younger, \u201cWho\u2019s Borrowing and Lending in the Fed Funds Market Today?,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, October 10, 2023, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/whos-borrowing-and-lending-in-the-fed-funds-market-today/.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in this post are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

The CAR T-cell therapy market is currently going through a rapid expansion, owing to rapidly expanding clinical trial activities and recent commercialization of CAR-T cell therapy, which are expected to offer lucrative opportunities for market expansion and flourishing opportunities. The rise in awareness and upsurge in approvals of new CAR T-cell therapies and promising advanced drugs present in pipelines are anticipated to offer remunerative opportunities for the expansion for the global CAR T-cell therapy market in the near future. Some of the benefits of CAR T-cell therapies over conventional drugs, include the destruction of cancer cells using patients' immune system, early recovery, and shortened treatment time. In addition, CAR T-cell therapy survives for a long time in the body, as they have the ability to recognize and target cancer cells even if the cancer relapses. According to a report released by Precedence Research, the global cell therapy market was valued at US$ 12 billion in 2022 and it is expected to hit US$ 83.78 billion by 2032, poised to grow at a CAGR of 21.50% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032. Further, an additional report by Allied Market Research stated the global car t-cell therapy market size was valued at $1.7 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $6.1 billion by 2031. Active biotech and pharma companies in the markets this week include Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Regen BioPharma, Inc. (OTCPK:RGBP), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY).\n\n\n\nPrecedence Research added: \u201cThe growth of global cell therapy market is attributed to the rising incidents of chronic disorders and infections. In addition, the growing cases of diabetes are also boosting the market growth. As per the International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Altas, almost 573 million persons globally had diabetes in 2022, with the number anticipated to grow by 643 million by 2032 and 783 million by 2045. Moreover, the growing number of research studies and clinical trials are also boosting the growth of global cell therapy market. One of the key factors propelling the expansion of global cell therapy market is adoption of innovative and latest technologies. Furthermore, after the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the market for cell therapy is growing at a rapid pace. With over 900 companies working on advanced therapeutics around the world and around 1,000 cell or gene therapy clinical studies now conducted, the cell therapy market might see a surge in number of approvals. According to industry experts, up to 60 new cell therapies could be developed in the next few years, curing around 350,000 patients in the U.S. alone.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRegen BioPharma, Inc.

(OTCPK:RGBP) has previously discussed initiation of a series of experiments to validate its DuraCAR CAR T-cell therapeutic while also identifying new, unexpected and potentially extremely useful findings in developing cell therapy treatments for autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe company has now received the first set of confirmatory data which demonstrates that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 were successfully created. In addition, the siRNA that is designed into the CAR T-cell was very highly expressed. Subsequent studies will determine if the expression of NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed or enhanced as a result of the high expression of siRNA.\n\n\"This is a major accomplishment in moving this model forward into therapies because in order to test whether we can genetically manipulate NR2F6 levels, we have to be able to produce a CAR T-cell where we demonstrate expression of this siRNA,\" says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to the company. \"We are excited to see the results on NR2F6 expression. If it is inhibited, we will focus on using these DuraCAR cells as originally envisioned - to attack solid tumors. If it is enhanced, we will begin re-tooling these cells to treat autoimmune disorders.\"\n\n\"We are delighted to get our first dataset from an independent CRO which shows that the CAR T-cells are doing what we expect and look forward to the next set of data which will inform us about the disease areas, whether autoimmunity or cancer, we will focus on,\" says Dr. David Koos, Chairman and CEO of the company.

And an abrupt slowdown in new and existing home sales is likely to have trickle-down effects for the broader economy if a sales rebound doesn't happen soon.\n\nTo remedy the current situation, the trade groups urged the Fed to make two statements:\n\n1. \"The Fed does not contemplate further rate hikes;\"\n\n2. \"The Fed will not sell off any of its mortgage-backed securities holdings until and unless the housing finance market has stabilized and mortgage-to-Treasury spreads have normalized.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fed has been reducing its balance sheet by rolling off and not reinvesting as much as $60 billion in Treasury bonds and as much as $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities every month.\n\nWhile the central bank hasn't been selling assets outright, this so-called quantitative tightening process has trimmed its balance sheet by about $1 trillion from the $9 trillion peak in March 2022.\n\n\"These steps will provide the market greater certainty about the Fed's rate path and its plans for the MBS portfolio and reduce volatility for traders and investors,\" the letter argued.\n\nThose two steps would also likely help improve home builder sentiment, which would go a long way in helping get new supply of homes to the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd increasing home supply would help bring down the inflationary shelter costs that have driven inflation higher over the past year.\n\n\"We urge the Fed to take these simple steps to ensure that this sector does not precipitate the hard landing the Fed has tried so hard to avoid,\" the letter concluded."}, {"title": "Market to Market - October 13, 2023 - Iowa PBS", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 23:47:52 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.iowapbs.org", "title": "Iowa PBS"}, "text": "Paul Yeager Coming up on Market to Market, the government reports less crop in the field, sending the market initially higher. So what's next? A panel discussion with Elaine Kub. Don Roose and Jeff French next.\n\nAnnouncer What's next? Doesn't happen by chance. It happens when researchers and farmers work together to solve tomorrow's agronomic challenges. We're committed to creating what's next because at Pioneer, our name is our mission tomorrow.\n\nAnnouncer For over 100 years, we've worked to help our customers be ready for tomorrow. Trust in tomorrow. In information is available from a Grinnell Mutual agent today.\n\nAnnouncer This is the Friday, October 13th edition of Market to Market, the weekly Journal of Rural America.\n\nPaul Yeager Hello, I'm Paul Yeager. Tensions in the Middle East garnered much of the attention of the world this week. The global markets watched while other economic data was fed into the algorithms. The Producer Price Index moved higher by half a percent in September.\n\nPaul Yeager The wholesale prices snapshot core reading ticked up 2/10 of a percent last month when food, energy and trade services were removed. The Consumer Price Index was up 4/10 of a percent, while the core reading increased by 3/10 of a percent. USDA also released a pair of reports that heavily influenced the commodity trade. On Thursday, we will discuss how long of a tail these reports will have and what's next.\n\nPaul Yeager Our panel to dissect the crop production and the supply and demand reports includes Elaine Kub, author of Mastering the Grain Markets. Don Roose, founder and president of U.S. Commodities. And Jeff French, founder of AgHedgers.com.\n\nBefore we get their thoughts, let's take a look at the week that was in commodities. The nearby wheat contract rose $0.12 while December corn added a penny.\n\nA harvest in full swing sales to destinations unknown and hot and dry conditions in South America served to help rally the soy complex. The November contract rallied $0.14 and December meal found 1790 per ton. December Cotton lost a 1.16 per hundred weight. Over in the dairy parlor. November class three milk futures increased $0.03. The livestock market was mixed.\n\nDecember cattle, they were up $0.07. November feeders put on $0.70 and the December lean hog contract cut for oh eight. In the currency markets, the US dollar index added 67 ticks. November crude well it gained 455 per barrel. COMEX gold rocketed $96 per ounce higher and the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index added almost 24 points to settle at 598.15.\n\nPaul Yeager Jeff and Don, hello to you. Elaine, I'll start with you. Your headline from Thursday from the reports was which commodity?\n\nElaine Kub I think I'm going to say corn, just because that's the one that everybody looks at. I mean, maybe just because it's the prettiest or certainly because it's the highest volume crop and it sort of serves as the proxy for the larger grain markets to develop what sort of direction they're going to go at. And the USDA cut the yield number down to 173.\n\nSo that that was a cut. I mean, I think that's what everyone expected or hoped to see. Let's say a market bull would certainly hope to see that after this drought summer. I think market bulls are going to say it should have been cut more, but the USDA is going to work in a conservative fashion. So to see that cut did allow some bullish response on Thursday.\n\nI mean, in terms of actual one day market movement, I think you'd say probably soybeans obviously had the bigger one day movement. But note it was a one day movement. We've had things go back down again here on Friday.\n\nPaul Yeager Don, did anybody call you yesterday and complain about USDA?\n\nDon Roose Well, you know, well, you know, not this report, but, you know, and I know what Elaine is saying, but I really think the surprise in the report was all about the soybean market. You know, corn, we have over 2 billion bushel carryout. Going to be hard to change that. The soybeans, the government surprisingly, they're keeping the ending stocks at 220.\n\nI think that's just because they believe that's the ending stocks. That's all that's the pipeline minimum. So I think the bottom line is the soybeans probably, in fact, all the grains probably have hit a seasonal low, and that's what the report indicated. And soybeans are the upside leader, along with soybean meal.\n\nPaul Yeager I'm going to ask you about Lowe's in a minute. But Jeff, I want to ask you, given listening about stocks and Kerry, did that get lost yesterday? And we had confirmation of a lower crop in your eyes?\n\nJeff French No, I don't think you got lost. I mean, the trade knows when the USDA lowers the yield in September and then in October, it's very likely that they will do it again in November.\n\nAnd if you look at soybeans, particularly the condition which the USDA does base awful lot, you would I would argue that you could see probably another half bushel reduction, if not a full bushel reduction going into November on that soybean crop. So the trade knows that, Yes, we had a big move. We we stalled out up there at $13, but we came in to that report on a dollar 50 slide.\n\nSo we're going to see here the pipeline supply is going to be tight in these beans and the supply is going to be tightening off all eyes on South America here.\n\nPaul Yeager Don, there was a little conventional wisdom on that going into today. If corn could close over five, that might mean the low is in. And if we could have closed over 585, the low as in neither happened on Friday. So do we have a low yet? And what will be the indicator of one?\n\nDon Roose Well, I mean, I think the seasonally we have I mean, the basis levels are starting firm and end users are starting to scramble a bit. Basis levels have started to firm corn market the ethanol people, the end users also starting to try and recover at these price levels can't do it. You know, it's amazing. Since the beginning of August, we basically have been in a fight for 72 $5 trading range.\n\nBut, you know, I think let's see, we get over five. There's a five, 25 and a half target gap on December. CORN That's probably the upside with a 2.1 billion carryover yet.\n\nPaul Yeager All right, Elaine, you get the first answer. Do you agree with that sentiment?\n\nElaine Kub No. I want to kind of play devil's advocate and I agree with you globally and long term. And I'm going to say may be past January once we finally get a grain stocks report that confirms my belief. And I think maybe all farmers believe that the crop just isn't there and the supply just isn't there. But I think between now and then, you've got a whole global market full of people who trade off of these these numbers and are going to continue to do so.\n\nAnd so while you have, let's say, the dollar moving higher or sort of outside market doldrums, I believe it's possible for it to continue to linger or dwindle even lower. I mean, I do think it's possible for it to move lower. And we saw that on Friday, that it is possible for it to move more, at least on a day to day basis.\n\nJeff French Oh, yeah. I mean, you saw it this week. I mean, we weren't able to take out those big resistance levels, But from a from a seasonal standpoint, I agree that, you know, seasonally harvest lows are in here. The low in corn hits September 19th. You know, you look back in years past that's ideal for us for harvest low and then beans 1250 yesterday so even in a non-ideal year.\n\nWell I mean we'll have to see. But I just think that harvest lows have been scored here.\n\nDon Roose You know, I think the big thing you have to look at is that the big competitor is South America. I mean, between Brazil and Argentina, they're going to raise about double the size of the crop we are here. So in order for the market to significantly move higher, South America is going to have to have some weather problems.\n\nAnd by the way, it's an El Nino year after three La Nina years. So that means that we're supposed to be dry in northern Brazil, which it kind of is.\n\nPaul Yeager I think you've all been on the show when we were supposed to be in El Nino years here, and it doesn't look like we've had it here yet. So do you still put stock in El Nino being a factor right now?\n\nElaine Kub Yeah, fundamentally, sure. But, you know, it just it takes, I think, time sometimes for these markets to recognize reality. Right. We like to believe in efficient markets where we're all of the traders are coming in with their opinions and they react instantly to to an or to a forecast. But I don't know. We just haven't seen it this year.\n\nI think it's going to be we're going to have to wait.\n\nPaul Yeager All right, Jeff, let's finish up corn here. Let's look out a little bit. And I want to look out with a question that came in. Let's see. This one came up via Facebook. This is from Tim. And I want you to answer this with corn in mind. Is there anything that points to A to storing grain for a rally in corn?\n\nJeff French Oh, I absolutely does. I mean, we're actually in a carry market in corn and and beans. First time that we've seen that here in a while. So, you know, we got about 70% sold. We're actually using this break that we've seen here off the summer highs to re own some of those bushels because we are looking for a postseason rally.\n\nPaul Yeager But absolutely, we're looking for prices to move higher here. I'll let either of you answer it with another commodity in mind. Would you store any wheat or soybeans? Go ahead.\n\nElaine Kub I'll just say yeah. I mean, I would store with with a bullish outlook. I mean, it's a speculation, but I would but I'll just make one comment that we are in a higher interest rate environment. And so now all of a sudden, storing and actually deferring that income matters in a way that it didn't matter a year ago.\n\nDon Roose Yeah, and I agree with Alan, it costs about $0.09 a month interest right now, $0.19 a bushel on interest to carry soybeans a month. I mean, so it's not like it was a year ago. So it's a big change, Paul.\n\nPaul Yeager So it's a different thing to think about now.\n\nDon Roose Time is money. Yeah.\n\nPaul Yeager And that's I think I think that's only been starting. I think you all have started bringing that up here in the last, well, say 6 to 9 weeks and moving forward with interest rates. We don't know. CPI pie last week, PKI, there's a little hesitation. There's some thought the Fed might still raise interest rates higher. So does that change your answer at all?\n\nDon Roose No, but I think what you're going to see is a producer pick up the selling pace on soybeans. But, you know, we're in a dangerous place right now as far as the soybeans, you know, believe in if it can move lower or higher. Typically, if you look at our market in the spring, it's hard to go lower because we have a lot of issues weather, this, that and the other thing.\n\nAnd I think that's where we're at with South America. Argentina is in a drought. It's a precarious situation with demand way under the market in China buying softer and wheat here lately, that's a big deal. You know, along with soybeans.\n\nPaul Yeager Well, Elaine, with with beans and the Chinese economy again this week, a couple of stories. It's still struggling. Chinese economy. What does that do for the person who just finished harvesting beans right now and what they should be doing?\n\nElaine Kub Yeah, being being careful. And, you know, the one thing that we haven't touched on is the need for cash. I mean, some folks are going to need to sell one way or another just to raise some cash. But I want to pick up on what Don said about the Chinese wheat purchase. That was a big wheat purchase and it is a reflection, again, that this is not just a North American market, certainly not wheat.\n\nI mean, it's the Australian drought. It's the drought going on in South America. All of these things are going to be able to move these markets wheat wise.\n\nPaul Yeager You want to you want to do anything more on beans before we go back to wheat.\n\nJeff French So I was going to just hit on wheat that, you know, it's not unheard of for China to buy U.S. wheat. I mean, they buy two or 300,000 metric tons per year. But now we've had purchases now three weeks in a row, and there there are triple normal amount of purchases right now.\n\nSo it is a good sign. I mean, we're down here at 3 to 4 year lows. So hopefully it keeps going.\n\nPaul Yeager All right. That's the beauty of this panel. We can just go with anywhere except I have to think of the control room right now and get back on page. Let's go wheat. Elaine, for let's go. Let's start in order.\n\nWheat wise, you mentioned finally a game. Finally, the last couple of weeks we've put on some positive news. Is this a blip or a trend?\n\nElaine Kub It might be a trend. And I think that that echoed sort of the thought of the larger sector. And I'm sorry to frustrate you and the control room, but now now I want to talk about like corn and soybeans and wheat altogether. So if China's buying China's pretty good at doing this marketing thing, you know, if they're getting in there and seeing these prices as a buying opportunities, and if everybody here at this table kind of feels pretty bullish about things.\n\nI mean, if you are in a situation where you are an end user or certainly a livestock feeder, you've got to think about these potential lows or the long term potential for for bullish activity in the next few months. And look at these as buying opportunities like China is okay.\n\nPaul Yeager I could tell I couldn't tell if you were both putting your heads up and down. Are you thinking we're bullish right now? Jeff?\n\nJeff French I'm not going to say bullish, but I mean, I'm just done being bearish. The wheat. I mean, they've thrown everything that this market right now. So I I'm if I'm short I got make sure that I got calls up above but I'm not sure down here for sure.\n\nDon Roose Well if you really look at these markets and that was the last report said it was a supply bullish market in a demand bearish market. So we need to reach a point to move higher. I mean, I think we've we've socked in low, you know, can we move how much higher is the question mark? And that's going to be dependent on the demand side of the market.\n\nAnd that's work in progress poll as there always is.\n\nPaul Yeager Demand is the story in you know Alan wants to talk about three commodities that's the story in all of them right now.\n\nElaine Kub Add in cotton to I think cotton the demand like that's where you start to see the global demand really starting to fall apart. And that's cotton's problem so far as yeah, global demand is struggling that.\n\nPaul Yeager So you're.\n\nElaine Kub Saying more and more commodities.\n\nPaul Yeager They're following along. Fantastic in there. It's so cotton. Are you saying cotton has a demand issue?\n\nElaine Kub Yeah, I think I mean, I mean clearly.\n\nPaul Yeager Yeah. But do you think then the other three grains that you mentioned are having, is the demand story positive or negative? Right now?\n\nElaine Kub I'm with Don. I'm I don't know. I don't know. I think.\n\nPaul Yeager Collingwood trends transitioning to we're not being so bearish I mean well.\n\nDon Roose The other thing that's going on is people interest rates are higher so people are more value conscious than they were before. In other words, you're not buying ahead and stockpiling because time is money. So I think that's part of what's going on. But China is still going to buy, what, 100 billion metric tons of soybeans. They're not leaving.\n\nIt's a matter of who's going to fill that case. And that's going to be dependent on what happens in South America. Trust me.\n\nPaul Yeager South America, I believe I'm going to get my regions wrong. One is wet, one is dry. Which commodity is impacted the most with South America move?\n\nDon Roose Well, Argentina is in a drought right now and Australia is in a drought. So those two are wheat. Brazil is about 51% planted or 52% planted on the first corn crop and they're planting about 11% of the soybean crop right now. It's dry. You know, we work with some people there and they're saying it's not last year. Last year, they were getting timely rains.\n\nThis year they're getting enough to maybe germinate in the north and then the south is too darn wet. Paul So it's it's this weather. We've seen it in the US and around the world. It's hit and miss and goes fast.\n\nPaul Yeager Okay. Jeff,\n\nJeff French all eyes on Brazil, 112 million acres that they're expected to plant here this winter. You know, that will be the biggest thing that I hear what our fundamentals look at. I mean, 220 million bushels is tight, but now with a big crop down in Brazil. So all eyes there.\n\nPaul Yeager All right, let's wrap up with beans. Do you feel deferred?\n\nLet's look next year, March, April, May and planting. Are you doing any sales for 24 yet?\n\nOkay, Don, anything more on beans for you?\n\nDon Roose Well, usually harvest isn't the best time to make new sales, Paul. Well, on the back to the soybeans in September, crop report were much tighter, yields probably going lower and we were the day of the September report, we were like 1342 for a low and 1372 for a high. So you can argue that we need to go up 70 to $0.80 just to get back to where we started.\n\nPaul Yeager Yes. Lane Do you agree?\n\nElaine Kub Yeah. But I will also say, I mean, it's never wrong to sell if it's profitable. And actually these are still technically profitable levels for a lot of folks. But I'll say one thing. Like Jeff mentioned, these prices, it'd be easier for folks to sell or to look years and ahead and start selling. If the prices sounded better. I mean, we just have such an anchor of the last couple of years when things were so much better.\n\nYou know, if you had said five years ago, you'd have a chance to sell 1250 beans or $5 corn, you'd be like, Oh yeah, sounds pretty good. But after last year's prices, now we're anchored so much higher and nobody wants to do it. So just, just a cautionary tale, just behaviorally to think about, you know, what is actually profitable and not just what was available six months ago or a year ago.\n\nPaul Yeager Anything else, Jeff? Beans, Corn.\n\nJeff French I just yes, I second that if it's profitable, I would never tell you to not sell grain, but I would definitely follow it up with, you know, some ownership on paper.\n\nPaul Yeager Okay, Let's move to livestock a little bit. Are we good on that? Can I. I'll try to get consensus of the table here.\n\nThis is the most, I think, out of control I think I've ever had this one. This is incredible. I love it. Don. Let's look at cattle, because that seems to be a tiny bit out of control with with with things that aren't normally talked about in the cattle market. It almost looks like it's a technical movement. Now. Do you concur?\n\nDon Roose Well, you know, we've got everybody's in the same camp. You know, Paul, it's a cyclical bull market. We haven't had that since 12, 13, 14. And so the trade wants to be bullish for another two years. I don't think it's that. I think it's back to the the demand side of the market. You know, like we always say, nothing's enough if nobody wants it.\n\nSo at what price? You know, we were sputtering right here. Now, seasonally on cattle, you're supposed to buy cattle basically Friday until the first week of November. And it's just the opposite of the hogs, you know, supposed to sell them. So you're in a little seasonal up on cattle, down on hogs.\n\nPaul Yeager Elaine, what do you think about technical fundamental movements in cattle market right now?\n\nElaine Kub I will defer to Don that, but I'll say that cash market this week was hot, hot, hot. I mean, it was up 2 to $3 this week to 92 dressed, 185 live. I mean, we're in a position now where record high beef prices at the retail grocery store level. And it's just a question of whether or not we can make record high actual cash prices for those Fed cattle.\n\nPaul Yeager Are we to the point at the consumer is going to step away from beef?\n\nJeff French We're not there yet, but I think it's it's soon. I mean, you had the former CEO of Walmart come out this week and say in the first time in a decade, the consumer is starting to buckle. So the consumer is starting to tight their belt.\n\nAnd obviously with beef prices where they are, there are much cheaper alternatives. So I think that will that will break the back. How far we go down from there, we'll have to see. But it has it's not happening yet, but I think it happens pretty smart pretty soon.\n\nPaul Yeager What do you think about the feeder market then?\n\nJeff French Big correction, We've come down here to support, you know, rallying back with the corn going higher. You know, these are expensive, expensive feeder cattle. If you're filling up the pen, we're just advising that you make sure you have downside protection locked in because 25, $30 move in feeders is not too big at these prices.\n\nPaul Yeager Let's ask the cattle feeder at the table. You fill in the pen.\n\nElaine Kub I don't I don't feed cattle, but I.\n\nPaul Yeager You have to play along with the that talk.\n\nElaine Kub To Don.\n\nPaul Yeager About I know he's got a few.\n\nElaine Kub but yeah no I mean I think we're looking at a fall run where again we're going to be setting maybe some record high prices which can, which can be possible. I mean, I think folks can make it work for quality level or certain, you know, for certain plays. But 250 feeder cattle, I mean, that's what we're going to see as as we start to see these calves come in.\n\nPaul Yeager Well, and I was I was looking in back to lower levels. I think the chart doesn't quite go back far enough. But, Don, July lows, we were we were close to that this week. Right on on feeders that we've dipped back down. Do you think we're at a crossroads here?\n\nDon Roose Well, you know, the thing about the feeder cattle, I mean, the numbers just aren't there, Paul. I think it was pretty impressive that the feeder cattle went up with the corn going up. So I think we have a floor there just from the numbers. And I don't think it's so much that I think is what happens to corn and then what happens with those defer hedge able opportunities and those are work in progress.\n\nIt's going to be tough for April cattle next year to go over 200. We tried and it's just a tough number, I think.\n\nPaul Yeager What about in the hog market this week? You know, you look at a sell off again and again. It has just been up and down. Where are we headed?\n\nDon Roose Well, the hog market's in huge liquidation. I mean, the Packers making about $32 a head, the vertical hog integrators losing about $20 a head. We've been in this massive liquidation and eventually, Paul, the liquidation should translate to higher prices next year. But the government says about 85 for all and next year we're substantially higher than that. But December hogs run in a $12 discount to the case.\n\nDon Roose Right now it's normally on par so upfront little cheap.\n\nPaul Yeager Elaine anything else on.\n\nElaine Kub Hogs just exactly that is seasonally that that the futures market is looking at heading down towards December probably bottoming out there at some point and then hopefully recovering. But yeah I think in the near term there's not a lot of hopeful signals from the market.\n\nPaul Yeager I want to get to crude oil for a minute, Jeff, what's going on in Israel, in Iran, in Gaza, in this area? Initially, there was this call that we were going to have $150 oil didn't come to fruition yet. Then the week progressed. How do you navigate what's happening globally and understanding what that means for us on the farm?\n\nJeff French Yeah, we came in Sunday, we spiked higher. We actually traded crude oil, traded lower all four days until Friday. You saw short covering come in. Nobody wants to be short. Crude oil going into the weekend because of the absolute uncertainty. I would just tell my clients that, you know, you put some call options up above here. If this thing wants to run another 15, $20 higher, you know, that is a great hedge to stay in the game.\n\nSo it's certainly part of it is out of our control. But what we can and control is if it wants to move higher, that call option can appreciate in value.\n\nPaul Yeager Elaine Do you see anything from what's happened this week globally that we need to be paying attention to in a market other than crude?\n\nElaine Kub No, and I think it's really interesting from the crude oil market. Exactly. Is, you know, I talked about an efficient market. If that market is really expressing the outlook of what is truly going to happen, it's been remarkably quiet and calm, which would suggest that it might, you know, the all the violence might be sort of contained in a certain region and not and not bring in everybody else.\n\nBut, of course, I don't know. We don't know. Nobody knows. But if the market knows, then so far we're okay. But yeah, you got to be you got to be aware and you got to keep your eye on it.\n\nPaul Yeager Don, Is there one commodity that you were watching this week with the eye of what was happening?\n\nDon Roose Well, I mean, I think if you look at it now, you've got issues in the Black Sea in the Middle East. And I think the problem with the livestock market in the grains on Friday was everybody just wanted to get back to home base. I mean, there's something's going to happen probably over the weekend, you know, in the Middle East.\n\nAnd we'll see what it is. But very interesting situation. A lot of I've seen one like that in my years of trading. All right.\n\nPaul Yeager Let's close with this. We have one question that I want to bring in. I want to look ahead. I want to look to Scott in Wisconsin's question that he submitted to us for your Facebook. This is looking to 24, Jeff. You already had one of those. So, Elaine, I'll start with you. What commodity do you see having the highest upside in 2024?\n\nElaine Kub Hmm. Great trick question. I you know any of them. But, but let's say corn even because I think there is so much potential for for the supply and demand under the understanding of that supply and demand picture to change. So from a percentage basis, I think a lot of the other commodities really haven't fallen apart in the way that our, you know, our core proxy corn has. And I think there is a lot of potential for that.\n\nPaul Yeager John, what do you like in 24?\n\nDon Roose I'd say soybeans have the upside potential in South America as a problem, but there's going to be a huge acre switch from soybeans to of corn into soybeans. In South America. Corn acres are production is going to be down about 700 million versus last year and beans up 200 million. So I think that's a prelude to what happens here in the U.S. But I'd keep my eye on soybeans just because it doesn't take them a lot to move the needle.\n\nPaul Yeager Jeff, 24, what's your big,\n\nJeff French you know, corn and wheat down here at multi-year lows? You know, I'll go with corn, but at the same time, you got to look at what we did in 23. I mean, look how short we were on rainfall. And look at the yields that we are seeing. I mean, it's it's not a record crop.\n\nIt's, you know, eight bushels below trend line. But those timely rains have produced a very good corn crop. And while it was very hot here in the United States, so I'd be careful on betting up to the topside, but we'll go with corn here. Right now.\n\nPaul Yeager The only thing, though, that could be is we had some rain last fall that helped set us up in 23. Not sure we'll get that. We'll see how that forecast works out. Jeff French, thank you so very much. Thank you, Don. Thank you. Thank you. Paul. I have to apologize to Elaine because I stuck her with that tough question right at the end. Sorry.\n\nElaine Kub I you know, we got we got there in the end. Paul, thank you.\n\nPaul Yeager Appreciate it. Thank you, all three. Great job, as always. That is going to do it. But I do want you to hold it because we are going to pause this discussion. We have to keep going because we have to talk about the discussion of these markets in our market Plus segment.

But investors can gain an advantage by understanding the forces that drove certain stocks higher or lower. You can prepare yourself for upcoming market trends by digging deeper beyond the headlines. It's always a good idea to review key trends to ensure that your portfolio allocation is aligned with long-term goals and short-term drivers. These four stocks had major moves last month that illustrate some of the important forces that are influencing the market right now.\n\n1. Target\n\nTarget (TGT -0.53%) shares slumped by 12.6% in September thanks to a number of gloomy macroeconomic indicators and headlines. The monthly retail sales data showed weakness in consumer goods, especially automobiles and other durables. Transaction data released by payment processors also suggested a pullback in household spending.\n\nThat all coincided with an unexpected slowdown in new housing starts, which is a strongly negative indicator of consumer confidence. It's taken a long time, but high interest rates are finally translating to clear signs of consumer strain. Consumer budgets are tightening as a softening job market is combining with inflation, expensive borrowing costs, and higher lending standards.\n\nThat flurry of shaky economic data came on the heels of a tough quarterly earnings season for consumer stocks and retailers. Target was one of several large retailers that published disappointing financial results and gloomy forward-looking commentary in August. Top-line stagnation combined with profit margin compression to paint an ugly picture for cash flows over the next few quarters.\n\nTarget was probably the highest-profile casualty of this trend, but there were several others that shared the drop. Dollar General and Dollar Tree both moved lower as investors grew concerned about their profit margins. Walmart stock held up much better, thanks to its ability to manage through weak periods, but it still dropped. A handful of retailers and consumer stocks were spared losses, but it's an overall bearish signal for the economy as a whole.\n\n2. Boeing\n\nBoeing (BA 0.01%) was another conspicuously weak performer in September, along with several of its major airline customers. The aircraft manufacturer provided forward-looking commentary at an investor conference that caused investors to doubt the company's ability to meet its previous forecasts for the full year.\n\nBoeing sells low volumes of extremely high-cost items to customers that are highly sensitive to economic cycles. Boeing itself has high fixed costs and a debt-heavy balance sheet that that pulls more than $10 billion of cash out of the company in the form of interest and principal repayments.\n\nBoeing also has almost $80 billion worth of inventory on its balance sheet, which can quickly become less liquid during tough times. These factors make the aerospace stock exceptionally sensitive to economic cycles and interest rates, and September's major economic news suggested that we should expect high interest rates and weak aggregate demand for multiple quarters to come.\n\nMajor airlines obviously have a different business model from Boeing, but they share some of the same characteristics and key business drivers. September's price charts for major airlines United, Delta, Southwest, and American Airlines were strikingly similar to one another and to Boeing last month, illustrating the powerful market forces that dictate performance for these sorts of companies. Debt-laden cyclical stocks are likely to remain volatile over the next few quarters.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NVDA 1.40%) 12% dip in September wasn't as extreme as some other stocks', but it exerts a ton of pressure on index performance with its trillion-dollar market cap. Semiconductor stocks struggled last month, thanks to growing concerns that demand is weaker than previously forecast, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) applications that have been fueling the sector's returns.\n\nLosses among growth stocks and the tech sector outpaced the market average last month. The Nasdaq Composite index, which is generally heavier on tech and growth stocks, fell 5.8% in September, nearly a full percentage point more than the S&P. The pain was especially bad after the Fed's announcement that interest rates are likely to remain high for the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestor risk tolerance deteriorated in September, making it tough for stocks with lofty valuation ratios like Nvidia. The semiconductor powerhouse is the most glaring example of a wider market trend that points to overall bearish sentiment for the time being. Growth investors need to maintain a long-term strategy and prepare for volatility in the short term.\n\n4. Dell\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Dell (DELL -0.41%) showed investors that there's still room for optimism in the stock market. Dell crushed Wall Street's revenue forecasts, and reported an upbeat outlook for the next year. That was in contrast to a gloomy report from its rival, HP, which had dampened expectations for all companies in the sector.\n\nDell's better-than-expected results and explicit focus on the opportunities created by AI were the fuel necessary for the stock to break free of broader market trends, soaring 22.5%.\n\nDell rose after reporting earnings, it capitalized on investor hype around AI, and it was bouncing back from previously lowered expectations. These were a very specific set of circumstances that caused the stock to overcome macro headwinds. While it won't always be that combination of catalysts, investors should still recognize that returns can be generated when companies report unexpected good news and stock valuations are reasonable.\n\nThe stock market might be volatile over the next few months, but it's not all doom and gloom. Stay allocated for long-term growth."}, {"title": "Charlottesville to reimpose curfew at Market Street Park - The Daily Progress", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:00:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://dailyprogress.com", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "text": "Charlottesville is reimposing its curfew at Market Street Park.\n\nCity Manager Sam Sanders\u2019 Friday announcement that the park will resume its previous operating hours of 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Oct. 21 means the homeless men and women who have been living in an encampment there for the past three weeks must find other shelter or risk being kicked out or cited for trespassing.\n\nSanders lifted the curfew at the park after Charlottesville residents reported to City Council that police had mistreated at least two homeless men at the park. Since then, 35 tents have been erected there.\n\nSome of those living at the park today have said they have no intention of leaving.\n\nDarnell Burton, who said he was among a small group that discreetly resided at the park even before the curfew was lifted, vowed to fight back and keep his tent up.\n\nBurton told The Daily Progress on Friday afternoon that the city doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to exile the park\u2019s tenants.\n\n\u201cShow me in the Code of Virginia where you can\u2019t have tents when the park is open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay here.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s in spite of the fact that the city has said its decision to reinstate the park\u2019s prior operating hours was made because additional overnight beds would be made available for the homeless.\n\nPeople and Congregations Engaged in Ministry, or PACEM, announced Thursday it would be opening its overnight shelter operations early this year. The group has operated an emergency shelter during the coldest months of the year in Charlottesville since 2004.\n\n\u201cOur regular open was scheduled for Oct 28,\u201d Liz Yohn, PACEM operations manager, told The Daily Progress on Friday. \u201cOur season will now run Oct 21-Apr 12.\u201d\n\nPACEM has 50 beds between two sites, Yohn said, and provides those accommodations and other resources in partnership with the city, Charlottesville First United Methodist Church, the Salvation Army and Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness , or PATH, a federal, state and local partnership that provides outreach and assistance to adults with serious mental illness who are experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of becoming homeless.\n\n\u201cWe meet folks where they are,\u201d PACEM board Chair Cliff Haury said in a Thursday statement, \u201cand we adapt to what they need. Right now, they\u2019re in the park and need shelter \u2014 that\u2019s something we already know how to address.\u201d\n\nThe city said it will be reimposing the curfew at the park to coincide with PACEM\u2019s early opening on Oct. 21.\n\n\u201cThe City of Charlottesville will resume operating hours in Market Street Park at 11:00 pm the same day,\u201d the city said in its Friday statement.\n\nThe city added that there are also beds available at the Salvation Army shelter on Ridge Street.\n\nThe Salvation Army told The Daily Progress on Friday it had four available beds at its shelter in the city.\n\n\u201cThere are four here,\u201d Brenda Smith, Salvation Army shelter manager, said. \u201cOne on the men and three on the women.\u201d\n\nEchoing Yohn\u2019s remarks, Smith said her organization would be working closely with PACEM once it opens on Oct. 21.\n\n\u201cI will be obliging them with 16 additional people to house. Eight for the men, eight for the women,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey won\u2019t have a bed, but they will be in the lounge.\u201d\n\nSanders said the city will continue to engage with groups that provide resources, including shelter, to the homeless population in Charlottesville as the park resumes normal hours and the men and women there move on.\n\n\u201cI have asked our staff to engage with various service providers to strategize ways we can support this process so that anyone in the park will receive the assistance that they need to ensure a smooth transition. This work has already begun and will continue through whatever period necessary,\u201d Sanders said in his Friday statement.\n\nThe Daily Progress reached out to Ashley Marshall, deputy city manager, for clarity on what other service providers the city is working with but did not receive a response by press time.\n\nSanders decided to lift the curfew at the park three weeks ago after residents reported to City Council that at least two homeless men at the park had been mistreated by the city\u2019s police \u2014 one kicked and another arrested for trespassing \u2014 and that officers were intentionally targeting the Black population at the park.\n\nAfter hearing what he called the \u201cdisgusting and disturbing actions\u201d alleged of his officers, Charlottesville Police Chief Michael Kochis launched an internal investigation that found those reports were groundless.\n\n\u201cIt has been determined that the allegations that our officers have been targeting Black, unhoused individuals with violence, and that officers have only been asking Black, unhoused individuals to leave the park, are unfounded and simply did not occur,\u201d Kochis said at a Sept. 28 press conference.\n\nAfter reviewing bodycam footage, Kochis determined that a homeless man sleeping on the ground at the park after the 11 p.m. curfew the night of Sept. 16 had not been kicked; he described the contact made between an officer\u2019s foot and the man a \u201ctouch.\u201d\n\nBodycam footage of the Sept. 12 arrest of Roscoe Boxley at the park shows the man sitting in a chair on one of the park\u2019s walkways, fully aware that he is about to violate the 11 p.m. curfew.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t got nowhere to go. Nowhere at all. Everywhere we\u2019ve been y\u2019all have ran us off,\u201d Boxley says to the officers.\n\nOne officer asks if Boxley had tried finding a bed at the Salvation Army.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019d be out here if I could get into Salvation Army?\u201d Boxley asks. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lock me up right now because I ain\u2019t going nowhere, and the only way I\u2019m going somewhere is if you lock me up. I\u2019m going to be heard one way or another.\u201d\n\nAt 11 p.m., Boxley stood from his chair and immediately put his hands behind his back, waiting to be arrested.\n\nThe number of people in Charlottesville who have fallen into homelessness has grown by 25% since 2018, according to the Blue Ridge Area Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates and leads collaborative efforts to address homelessness.\n\nAt the Sept. 28 press conference, Kochis suggested that at the root of the homeless crisis in Charlottesville is not the police response to a park curfew but the resources available to those in need.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be frank. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve worked in two other jurisdictions, the city of Alexandria and the town of Warrenton,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth had a 24-hour shelter with wraparound services, and I\u2019ve never been in a jurisdiction that hasn\u2019t had either.\u201d\n\nDirectly across the street from Market Street Park sits the Haven, a homeless resource center in the former First Christian Church which has been in operation since 2010. But the Haven only provides shelter services during the daytime, and the city prohibits it from operating at night.\n\nExecutive Director Anna Mendez told The Daily Progress that while the city has indicated a willingness to reconsider that decision, it is still in the very early stages of that conversation.\n\n\u201cIt would be incredibly premature to put any type of timeline on it,\u201d Mendez said.\n\nThe Haven announced it will be hosting a \u201cHousing First & Homelessness\u201d event Nov. 13.\n\n\u201cHave you grappled with the questions, \u2018Are there evidence-based solutions to homelessness? What are we doing locally to end homelessness, and what challenges do we face in implementing these efforts in our community?\u2019 If so, join us Monday,\u201d an invitation to the event reads.\n\nThose interested in attending can register online at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/housing-first-homelessness-in-charlottesville-tickets-727558877187?aff=oddtdtcreator.\n\nDaily Progress reporter Hawes Spencer contributed to this story."}, {"title": "The market's rate expectations - Goldman Sachs", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 16:36:54 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.goldmansachs.com", "title": "Goldman Sachs"}, "text": "This week saw a reversal in the US bond market, which has been marked by declining prices and rising yields.

These factors have moved financial markets in recent days \u2013 but not necessarily as one might have expected.\n\nUS labour market \u2013 Job creation rebounds\n\nNet job creation in September and upward revisions to the data for the previous two months have raised a big question: is there a slowdown in the US labour market? Non-farm payrolls came in at 336 000 in September \u2013 almost double the expected 180 000. Third-quarter monthly net job creation averaged 266 000, well above the second quarter\u2019s 201 000.\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 household survey was less favourable, showing a stable unemployment rate at 3.8% (up from 3.5% in July) and a slight fall in job leavers at 12.7% of unemployed persons (down from 15.8% a year earlier). A high level for this indicator suggests employees are confident that jobs are plentiful meaning they could easily switch from one job to another.\n\nThe slowdown in the pace of wage increases (see Exhibit 1) appears to be part of the same trend: the labour market is gradually becoming less favourable to employees as supply and demand rebalance slowly.\n\nDoes the prospect of the labour market normalising explain the correction after the initial knee-jerk reaction that sent the yield of the 10-year Treasury note spiralling to above 4.85% and the 30-year yield to 5.05% in the wake of the job report\u2019s release on Friday 6 October?\n\nIt could be so. But US bond market positioning adjustments before a three-day weekend may also have played a part. And the attack on Israel on 7 October prompted a flight-to-safety, benefiting government bonds at the expense of equities.\n\nReally \u2013 \u2018at the expense of equities\u2019? Then what about the 3.2% increase in the MSCI AC World index in US dollar terms in the week that straddled those events, 4-11 October?\n\nPavlov\u2019s markets\n\nMarket observers are used to the market\u2019s occasional bout of \u2018bad news is good news\u2019 contrariness, when bad economic news is greeted by a rise in equities (or vice versa).\n\nWe are probably currently faced with another, equally specious type of reasoning: \u2018a fall in bond yields (for whatever reason) leads to a rise in equities\u2019.\n\nAccording to the latest theory to join the club of circular reasoning the rise in long-term bond yields tightens financial conditions, which means that the US Federal Reserve may (or even must) respond by loosening monetary policy. Even if that seems logical, it\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n\nIn a speech on 9 October, Fed Vice-Chair Phillip Jefferson illustrated the dilemma that the Fed will face in the coming months. Suggesting that the recent rise in real yields is a consequence of a stronger-than-expected economy that requires keeping monetary policy tighter for longer, he said: \u2018I am also mindful that increases in real yields can arise from changes in investors\u2019 attitudes toward risk and uncertainty. Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields as I assess the future path of policy\u2019.\n\nWhere is inflation going?\n\nThe latest inflation news has been encouraging, showing a widespread slowdown of both core inflation and services prices. While some upside surprises remain possible, the dynamics of price increases have changed dramatically from 2022 and early 2023, raising hopes of an \u2013 albeit slow \u2013 return of inflation to central banks\u2019 targets.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund devoted a chapter in its most recent World Economic Outlook report to the role of short-term inflation expectations on actual inflation dynamics. It appears to us that one of its key conclusions is that \u2018improvements in monetary policy frameworks and communications can help lower the output costs needed to reduce inflation and inflation expectations, making it more likely the central bank can achieve a soft landing.\u2019\n\nThe latest European Central Bank (ECB) consumer expectations survey found that, despite monetary policy tightening since July 2022, households anticipate inflation at 3.5% over the next 12 months (median point) with a wide dispersion.\n\nThe minutes of the September US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed that a growing number of members are concerned about tightening financial conditions. They consider it important to \u2018balance [the] risk of overtightening against [that] of insufficient tightening\u2019 and that their discussions should now focus on \u2018how long\u2019 policy should be kept restrictive, rather than \u2018how high\u2019 policy rates should rise.\n\nThis roadmap implies that the Fed will \u2018proceed carefully\u2019 in the short term, with official rates likely on hold in November, but no rapid cuts after that.\n\nWhere are bonds going?\n\nExplaining the upward pressure on long-term bond yields in September (+46bp on the US 10-year T-note yield; +37bp on the German Bund 10-year yield; +66bp on the Italian BTP yield) and early October is a tough task.\n\nIs it a temporary phenomenon linked to adjustments in investor positions in this new transition period (end of the tightening cycle, revisions to market expectations of rapid policy rate cuts in 2024)? Or is it a reaction to a resilient US economy, with the usual contagion effect on European bond markets?\n\nWhat cannot yet be ruled out is that the deterioration in bond yields in the third quarter stemmed from some investors seeking to obtain a better risk premium in the middle of uncertainty, as the Fed Vice Chair pointed out.\n\nAs for the growth outlook in the coming quarters, in our view the consensus seems a little too optimistic, ignoring the risk of a slowdown in activity.\n\nWithout even taking into account the specific risks in the US (auto workers\u2019 strikes, end of the freeze on the repayment of student loans), a slowdown would normally be the \u2018natural\u2019 consequence of the brutal monetary tightening since 2022, whose effects seem to be delayed in this cycle compared to the past. The fact is, parts of the US economy such as the housing market are starting to suffer from rising interest rates.\n\nIn this context, we decided to keep our overweight position in the fixed income pockets of our diversified portfolios. Volatility may remain high in the short term, not only for technical reasons, but also because finding consensus in assessing the likelihood of the various possible scenarios is difficult.\n\nDisclaimer"}, {"title": "Navigating the storm: Lessons learned from the mobile market's ... - GamesIndustry.biz", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 14:44:43 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.gamesindustry.biz", "title": "GamesIndustry.biz"}, "text": "The article represents the mobile gaming market analysis prepared by the MGVC team. The findings and conclusions are based on the range of analytical solutions that include data.ai, Newzoo, and others.\n\nFor quite a while the gaming market was considered by some to be an evergreen industry that thrives regardless of the worldwide economic situation.\n\nNikita Matsokin\n\nAnd it's no wonder such beliefs were common, as the videogames market has been growing for the last 30 years, performing relatively well even during the tough 2007-2008 crisis. In 2020, not the best time for many sectors, the revenues of video game companies increased by 23.1% (Newzoo).\n\nHowever, everything changed when 2022 hit the world. According to data.ai, the size of the video game industry in 2022 amounted to $193 billion, a 5% decrease from the 2021 figures. Another \"novelty\" was that the leader of the fall was the mobile games segment which comprised more than half of the overall gaming industry and declined by almost 7%.\n\nIn comparison, the decrease in the console games revenue was 3.4%, while that of the PC games was just 1%. But what could possibly go wrong in a market that has been blossoming for more than a decade and that was not (or at least not dramatically) impacted by significant economic declines? Let's dive into the details.\n\nMobile has lost a bit of momentum\n\nWhat happened to the mobile games market in 2022\n\nFor the last decade, the mobile sector has been a key driver of the video game industry's growth. However, as I've already mentioned, 2022 puts a pause on the mobile gaming industry's previous rapid expansion. Here are some of the factors that affected the market's decline in 2022:\n\nChange in players' payment behaviour that might be associated with a decrease in disposable income. On the graph from data.ai, we can observe that disposable income and consumer spending in games in the USA behave very similarly and a drop in the former starting from Q2'2021 is aligned with a decrease in the latter. This likely affected return on investment models of mobile publishers, making them more conservative and targeting shorter timelines for seeing a return on their investment.\n\nDisposable Income and Spend in Games, USA (State of Mobile Gaming Report 2023, data.ai) Growing competition for players' attention with short video services and streaming services. The choice for the mobile audience is not only which game to play, but also whether to play or to spend time in other apps. And their choice often seems to fall on short video services that in 2022 accounted for 17% of all mobile time spent. One of the most popular ones is TikTok, which surpassed one billion MAU (monthly average users) in September 2021. It's worth mentioning that streaming services as a whole are a significant competitor, being the No. 1 category of non-gaming apps by downloads and revenue in 2022 (according to data.ai).\n\nA long-term effect of Apple's IDFA depreciation. Currently, only 45% of iOS customers opt for tracking which results in an associated change in the way publishers manage User Acquisition, as older higher-spending cohorts that consist of well-targeted players were replaced with less-targeted and less monetized ones.\n\nIncreased competition within genres resulted in the game quality bar and the cost of user acquisition rising significantly, making it extremely complicated for new games to break through.\n\nThese issues have affected not only small and medium-sized studios but also large players who find it increasingly difficult to launch new games in the changed market environment. From the headlines, we know that EA cancelled mobile Apex Legends and Battlefield games and Playtika suspended its new game launches until the marketing landscape improves.\n\nEven large players have found it increasingly difficult to launch new games in the changed market environment\n\nNow that we've discussed the preconditions, let's consider the consequences (the data) in more detail. We've analyzed the evolution of mobile market trends on a subgenre basis by creating custom models based on data.ai featuring the changes in the key genres and subgenres according to data.ai taxonomy year by year.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that all the data we provide regarding the market size, the size of the genres, and the size of specific regions is based on our model (if not stated otherwise). In the model, we rely on the data.ai taxonomy. The revenues of markets, genres, subgenres, and specific titles were obtained from data.ai. data.ai always works on improving its data, which is why the numbers we show in this article might be different from the numbers currently shown by data.ai (as, unfortunately, we cannot constantly update this text). Also, note that we only consider the revenue generated by paid downloads and/or in-app revenue net of 30% platform commission that goes to the iOS and Google Play stores. We do not account for revenue generated outside the app stores, such as advertising and e-commerce. Keep in mind that ad revenue also plays an important role in the overall size of the gaming market and the size of each of the regions/genres.\n\nNow that you've read the disclaimer and know that the picture below in no way covers the whole market size (ads-driven monetization is missed, at least), let me note that we still can make some useful conclusions and get the idea of how the market was behaving in 2022.\n\nSo what's this circle about? On each petal, the size of the genre/subgenre in 2022 is represented as well as the difference in size compared to 2021. The petals are also coloured based on the direction and the volume of the change in the size of a genre/subgenre. Some of the key revenue-generating titles in the genres are highlighted in the picture below.\n\nMy.Games breaks down the 2022 mobile market by genre and subgenre\n\nWell, you might have heard that the global mobile gaming market dropped by 7% in 2022, but let's break that down a bit.\n\nRPG, Strategy, and Match genres that were the leaders by revenue (and together comprised more than half of the market) all decreased by more than 5%. The drop in the RPG sector was mainly caused by the poor performance of the Team Battles subgenre, the revenue of which dropped by 20%.\n\nEven though the Strategy genre itself did not perform so well, it is significant to highlight the Auto Chess subgenre that increased by more than 20% with TFT China being the key revenue driver. The Merge subgenre (which is a part of the Match genre in our analysis) also posted growth of more than 20%, with Merge Mansion and Merge County being among the leaders.\n\nEven though the overall industry environment was pessimistic, some genres managed to show good results\n\nEven though the overall industry environment was pessimistic, some genres managed to show good results. The revenue of Action games increased by 21% thanks to the strengthening of the MOBAs. One of the key revenue drivers there was Honor of Kings. The Party genre also increased, though less significantly (by 8%). An honorable mention in the genre is, of course, goes to the Stumble Guys game.\n\nNow that we have a clearer picture of what was going on in different genres, it's time to talk about regions.\n\nWestern markets (Tier-1: USA, Germany, France, Great Britain, etc.) accounted for $25 billion in revenue and comprised 44% of the global industry. With a 12% drop in 2022, the Western region was one of the key drivers of the global mobile gaming industry decline. Top-3 genres in the region by revenue volume were Match ($4.7 billion), Strategy ($4.5 billion), and Casino ($4.1 billion) which decreased by 5%, 12%, and 10% respectively. RPG revenue also declined by 12%, while Party was the only genre that had positive dynamics showing an 8% growth.\n\nIn Asia (not including China), the situation was similar - the mobile gaming market dropped by 10% getting down to $16.9 billion. Unlike the worldwide trend, in Asia, the Party games' revenue decreased by 37%, although the Party games segment is very small in this region with only $96m in in-app revenue in 2022. In general, all the genres faced a decline apart from Casino ($707m) and Action ($619m) games, which increased by 13% and 7% respectively.\n\nThe emerging markets (i.e. South America, Turkey, etc.) comprise less than 5% of the global mobile gaming market with $2.7 billion of in-app revenue in 2022, though mobile gaming in these regions had much more positive dynamics. The mobile gaming industry in emerging markets increased by 5% in 2022 with most of the genres supporting this growth. The growth leaders in these regions were Party ($137m) and Match ($225m) games that increased by 50% and 16% respectively. However, not all genres were flourishing in emerging markets in 2022. The revenue of RPG ($553m), Sports ($108m), and Racing ($21m) games decreased by 6%, 2%, and 12% respectively.\n\nLast but not least, it's important to highlight that China is a huge part of the worldwide mobile gaming market. On iOS, the in-app revenue of mobile games in China in 2022 was $10.8 billion, which is a 19% increase compared to 2021. However, as we do not have the data on the Android performance in this region, a detailed analysis would not be meaningful, as Android stores play a significant role in this region.\n\nOkay, that was lots of data, but it was essential to dive into the figures to get the whole picture. But what's going on in 2023? (Attention: a bit more data is arriving).\n\nAccording to the results of the first half of 2023, we can say that the market has reached a plateau. In its latest report, Newzoo predicts the mobile gaming market to rise by 0.8% in 2023, which is not a lot, but an increase after all.\n\nHowever, according to our model that is based on the data.ai data (don't forget about the disclaimer while looking at the figures), the results of the first half of 2023 show that the market has decreased by 1% compared to the first half of 2022 and is currently estimated to be $28.7 billion (once again, it's a figure for half a year).\n\nParty games continue growing, showing more than a 60% increase compared to the first half of 2022\n\nParty games continue growing, showing more than a 60% increase compared to the first half of 2022, with Eggy Party and Monopoly Go being among the key growth drivers. By the way, Monopoly Go deserves an honorable mention, as this fresh release has gained strong positions on the Luck Battle market that has been historically dominated by the Coin Master. It even managed to outperform Coin Master (what seemed to be nearly impossible for quite a while) in terms of in-app revenue in August 2023, according to data.ai.\n\nMatch games recovered from a drop in 2022 and have earned $3.5 billion in the first half of 2023, even exceeding the figures of the first half of 2021 mainly due to the outstanding performance of the Gardenscapes, Royal Match, and the Candy Crash titles.\n\nDespite the positive dynamics of the Party and Match genres, the continuing decline in the revenue of RPG, Shooting, and Strategy games (they decreased by 3%, 22%, and 13% respectively) prevents the mobile gaming market from getting back on its growing track. However, there are some very interesting releases in 2023 in these genres that are worth mentioning. One of them is, of course, Honkai: Star Rail from the Genshin Impact developer MiHoYo. The game was released in April 2023 and shows impressive performance on mobile (which is not that much of a surprise, to be honest). Another promising release is White Out Survival, a survival strategy game that made its way to the top-20 strategy games by in-app revenue in H1 2023 according to data.ai.\n\nReasons for investment share decline in the gaming industry\n\nNow let's take a look at the investment environment in the games industry based on the data from InvestGame.\n\nInvestment deals grew with the pandemic, both in the number of deals and the size of them\n\nPrior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of transactions and the volume of investments in the gaming industry was set at a certain level. Everything changed with the onset of the pandemic \u2014 many industries had to tighten up. As a result, investors \u2013 including institutional ones \u2013 drew their attention to games. This brought a large amount of investment into the gaming industry from venture investors, strategic holdings, and so on.\n\nThe \"feast\" lasted until mid-2022, after which the Western markets slowed down. As a result, investors became much more careful and conservative. We see that in Q3 and Q4 of last year, the volume of investments significantly dropped along with a decrease in the volume of transactions. Q1 and Q2 of 2023 have also been on a downfall, however, the results of Q3 are about to be significantly different probably not by the number of deals, but definitely by their size, as Savvy Games Group closed its acquisition of Scopely for $4.9 billion in July and the acquisition of Rovio by Sega for approximately $775 million closed in mid- August.\n\nAs a result, we can conclude that investors are still active, but they are now much more cautious. They have significantly raised their expectations regarding the companies and projects in which they are ready to invest.\n\nNow let me elaborate a bit more on the reasons behind the drop in the volume of the late-stage and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) transactions at the beginning of 2023. Late-stage means investments in already established businesses, when there is a new spark for their growth, and M&A is when the ownership of the entity is transferred to or consolidated with another company.\n\nThe volume of late-stage transactions has decreased because investors find it more complicated to further monetize their investments in a turbulent market. Considering M&A, shareholders of companies that have seen high valuations in a hot market are not ready to sell their shares at much lower prices.\n\nAs a result, there are fewer strategic investors and less buyers' activity, because everyone is careful with their money, and can no longer participate in the bull run for higher multipliers and valuations. Now buyers are more inclined to deeply dissect the targets and really understand the underlying synergies and benefits for the business that comes as a result of the M&A. However, the examples of Scopely and Rovio deals give hope that the videogames M&A market is about to revive and to return if not to the activity levels of 2020-2021, but to the pre-pandemic figures.\n\nTo sum up, 2022 has opened a new chapter in the history of the mobile gaming industry. Indeed, it brought its difficulties, and many teams, both small and big ones, had to reconsider their strategies and future plans. However, these unsettling times have also opened lots of opportunities. There are many talented developers all over the world, and I believe that we all, as the mobile gaming industry, will learn the lessons of the past year and will find new ways to create even better games.\n\nJust don't forget the basics: the foundation of a successful product is always a fun gameplay and an exciting gaming experience that make players return to your game."}, {"title": "Vintage antiques popular at the High Point Furniture Market this ... - Spectrum News", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:30:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com", "title": "Spectrum News"}, "text": "HIGH POINT, N.C. \u2014 The High Point Furniture Market is a huge economic driver.

Here's Why It Doesn't Matter - The Motley Fool", "date": "Sat, 14 Oct 2023 12:15:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "text": "Investors love bull markets. A bull market means the stock market is rising, which is what stock investing is all about, right?\n\nThat's a bit simplistic, and there are reasons why investors should embrace bear markets when prices aren't rising so quickly too. Here's why.\n\nThe advantages of a bull market\n\nOne of the primary purposes of investing is to grow your wealth. However, success in investing usually is the result of remaining invested over a long period of time. Stocks that appreciate thousands of percentage points -- or more -- do so over long periods, not overnight, and most definitely not in one year. However, most of their growth happens during bull markets, when the market is optimistic and everyone is buying.\n\nThe downside of a bull market is that valuations can become very high quickly, constraining buying opportunities. Eventually stock prices fall back, but great stocks rarely lose all of their gains. Even when they lose a massive amount, they typically gain it back, and more, when a bull market returns.\n\nThe advantages of a bear market\n\nThere are varying definitions of a bear market, but one of the more standard ones is when the market decreases 20% from its previous high. It doesn't get back to a bull market until it surpasses its previous high. Last year we entered a bear market, and although the S&P 500 is up 12% this year and has been even higher, we are still officially in a bear market. You can see from this chart when the market began to climb after crashing in 2020 and stayed elevated until last year.\n\nWhen stocks are down in a bear market, that's the time to buy. One of Warren Buffett's most famous quotes is \"We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.\" That's because when others are greedy, prices go up and often hit unsustainable levels. Drops are almost inevitable. Bear markets, when valuations deflate, correct prices and are prime stocking up opportunities.\n\nNo one likes to see the value of their portfolios decline, but bear markets provide a window to leverage the decreases and maximize opportunities.\n\nUse both to your advantage\n\nThere are many different approaches to investing. One of them is a \"set and forget\" mentality. If you evaluate a company and determine that it's a worthwhile investment, you can buy the stock and more or less move on for decades. While this could result in some losses, it also shields you from the anxiety and fear that could accompany frequent or daily stock checks. There are bound to be ups and downs, bull and bear markets, black swan events and more throughout your investing journey. Great businesses will weather all kinds of storms and reward you eventually.\n\nEven if you take a more hands-on investing approach, where you buy and sell more regularly, you'll do your best investing when you make your decisions based on the company itself and not on external factors. Instead of ignoring the external environment, you can use it to your advantage by leaning into what the market can provide for you. In bear markets, it will be buying great stocks at low prices. That is likely to require being able to see the bigger picture. Some examples of excellent stocks at low prices, but with excellent free cash flow generated by the underlying business, to buy today are Home Depot, which is trading at a valuation of 18 times trailing 12-month earnings, or close to a 3-year low, and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 45, or near half its five-year average.\n\nOnce you've identified the top stocks for your portfolio, part of the process is ignoring the noise in the background. What you don't want to do is panic sell when prices go down. It doesn't matter if we're in a bear market or a bull market; hold on to great stocks through thick and thin, and you're likely to come out on top."}, {"title": "PJM Files Changes to Capacity Market To Promote Reliability - PJM Inside Lines", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 20:52:23 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://insidelines.pjm.com", "title": "PJM Inside Lines"}, "text": "PJM today submitted proposed market reforms designed to support reliability of the electric grid now and in the future amid increasingly extreme weather and a changing generation fleet. As part of its commitment to maintain reliable electric service during the transition to a lower-carbon grid, and in the wake of recent extreme weather events, PJM filed its proposal (PDF) with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after more than a year of stakeholder meetings followed by an accelerated and intensive stakeholder process that began in February.\n\nCapacity market enhancements to the PJM Tariff aim for implementation beginning with the 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction (BRA), scheduled for June 2024. The proposed reforms are designed to:\n\nEnhance how PJM accounts for generator reliability-related risk in its models and sets procurement targets.\n\nAdvance an accreditation framework for all resources to reflect the actual capacity value that those resources provide to consumers.\n\nReform certain rules related to the Capacity Performance program, which establishes accountability for generator performance during system emergencies.\n\nImprove generator testing, including operational and seasonal requirements.\n\nRevise the Market Seller Offer Cap and Minimum Offer Price Rule to better include costs of taking on a capacity obligation and adopt a forward-looking Energy & Ancillary Services Offset.\n\nEnhance rules related to a unit-specific Market Seller Offer Cap.\n\nBetter align Fixed Resource Requirement rules with the capacity market construct.\n\nThe proposal reflects stakeholder collaboration that began in October 2021 with the establishment of PJM\u2019s Resource Adequacy Senior Task Force. Following more than a year of stakeholder meetings, in February of this year, the PJM Board initiated an accelerated Critical Issue Fast Path \u2013 Resource Adequacy process that concluded in September with an advisory vote to inform PJM Board action.\n\n\u201cPJM and the PJM Board thank stakeholders for their focused consideration of market reforms designed to support resource adequacy and grid reliability,\u201d said PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana. \u201cThe grid is evolving, and our markets must also adapt to facilitate the energy transition without sacrificing reliability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposal, while enhancing reliability, would maintain fundamental principles of competition that control costs for consumers as well as incentivize investment in new resources,\u201d said PJM\u2019s Adam Keech, Vice President \u2013 Market Design & Economics.\n\n\u201cThese proposed capacity market reforms will help PJM do what we do best \u2013 operating markets that attract critical investment in the resources we need to keep the lights on,\u201d added Keech. \u201cMaintaining enough resources that can support reliability are crucial to PJM\u2019s ability to serve demand through the transition to a less carbon-intensive grid.\u201d PJM recognizes stakeholder interest in continuing targeted collaboration on additional market enhancements, including a more granular approach to the capacity market, and will engage with stakeholders in pursuing these areas through various stakeholder venues.\n\nProposal filings:"}, {"title": "Emerging-Market Stocks Sink to Lowest Since 1987 Relative to US Equities - Yahoo Finance", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:47:56 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Finance"}, "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market stocks just crossed another grim milestone: They\u2019ve tumbled to the lowest level in 36 years relative to US equities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMSCI Inc\u2019s benchmark for developing-nation equities slipped to begin the week as Israel\u2019s retaliation against attacks by Hamas sparked fears of a broader conflict between the US and Iran.\n\nThat took the gauge, as of Monday\u2019s close, to the weakest-ever level relative to the S&P 500 Index in data going back to 1987. The ratio has since recovered, with the emerging-market benchmark adding 2.3% in the past two days.\n\n\u201cInvestors need to look beyond the benchmark index given the 30% China weight, as emerging-market performance ex-China has done much better than the index alone indicates,\u201d said Jitania Kandhari, deputy chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cSelective countries in EM are doing well.\u201d\n\nBroad emerging-market benchmarks have faced several headwinds this year, with the latest selloff in shares since July wiping out $1.8 trillion of shareholder wealth. The MSCI gauge erased all of its 2023 gains last month and is little changed for the year, compared with a 14% rally in the S&P 500.\n\nThe drop has come as traders bet that higher-for-longer interest rates in the US lead to further dollar strength, keeping pressure on riskier assets. China\u2019s stumbling economy has also been central to recent underperformance, especially as the nation\u2019s companies account for roughly a third of the broad emerging-market gauge.\n\n\u201cFor the broader EM index to start outperforming, investors need to see concrete actions for a strong recovery from the Chinese administration,\u201d said Ashish Chugh, head of global emerging-market equities at Loomis, Sayles & Co. in Boston.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe earnings performance and outlook of developing-nation companies has also been deteriorating, leading investors to shun the assets despite cheaper valuations. Consolidated profits at emerging-market companies, based on a trailing 12-month basis, have fallen to the lowest level since May 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nEquity analysts have cut their forecasts for 12-month profits at developing-nation companies by 2.8%, while they have raised the projections for US firms by 4.5%.\n\nThat leaves outperformance within emerging-market stocks likely to be limited to those that benefit from strong growth dynamics, said Loomis\u2019s Chugh.\n\n\u201cIndia, Indonesia and Brazil are doing very well \u2014 both cyclically and structurally \u2014 and should continue to deliver strong returns,\u201d he said. \u201cThe driver of their performance will continue to be strong earnings growth, as well as a supportive macro environment.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"title": "First Whole Foods Market in Jersey City to Open Nov. 9 - Whole Foods Market", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 13:12:59 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://media.wholefoodsmarket.com", "title": "Whole Foods Market"}, "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J.

That has allowed people who don't have a lot of capital the chance to invest in blue-chip companies that might otherwise be trading at per-share prices that are too high for them.\n\nThe platform has also been blamed for the rise of meme stocks. And another big shortcoming is that it doesn't offer investors the ability to buy mutual funds or individual bonds.\n\nThe Robinhood 100 list -- which features the most widely owned stocks in its members' portfolios -- doesn't always have all the best stocks to invest in, but they are certainly popular ones.\n\nTwo stocks on the list that stand out for me in terms of their potential to beat the market over the next year or so are Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX 3.68%) and Realty Income (O 0.30%). The first is a fast-rising pharmaceutical company, and the other is a steady real estate investment trust (REIT) that has a remarkable reputation for raising its dividend.\n\nDespite its potential, Catalyst is underpriced\n\nCatalyst Pharmaceuticals' shares are down 31% so far this year, despite the biopharmaceutical company being en route to its biggest year for revenue and earnings. The company focuses on rare diseases, and has been able to finance the development of its current candidates because of the sales success of Firdapse, the drug for treating Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), an autoimmune disorder that leads to muscle weakness. More than half of LEMS patients also develop small-cell lung cancer.\n\nIn the second quarter, the company reported record revenue of $99.5 million, up 87.5% year over year. While Firdapse brought in $64.9 million of that (up 22% over the same period last year), the company is seeing good sales from Fycompa, an epileptic antiseizure drug that it purchased the U.S. rights to from Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai on Jan. 25 for $160 million. Last year, Eisai reported that it expected $136 million in Fycompa sales in fiscal 2022, and for 2023, Catalyst is predicting $130 million in revenue from the drug in slightly less than a year of sales.\n\nWith a strong balance sheet, Catalyst purchased another asset that could start to pay off as early as next year. In July, it paid Santhera Pharmaceuticals roughly $231 million, plus royalties for the rights to Vamorolone, a potential first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nThe drug candidate already has Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the Food and Drug Administration, which is due to make an approval decision on it by Oct. 26. If approved, the drug could compete in a relatively large market -- there are 11,000 to 13,000 people in the U.S. with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nIn the second quarter, the company's net income was $37.8 million, up 74.7% over the same period last year, while earnings were $0.33 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Those results led the company to raise its full-year revenue guidance to between $380 million and $390 million, compared to the $214.2 million it reported last year.\n\nDespite those numbers, the stock trades at less than 13 times earnings (compared to the average price-to-earnings ratio of around 19 for drug manufacturers) and slightly more than 8 times forward earnings.\n\nRealty Income's price is finally right\n\nThe biggest problem before now for Realty Income was that the REIT had gotten a little too popular, so its stock was overpriced.\n\nThe company is one of the few that pays dividends monthly, and that, along with the company's strong tradition of raising its payouts regularly, helps explain the stock's popularity among Robinhood's retail investors. The huge REIT owns or has interests in 13,118 properties, leased to 1,303 clients across 85 industries.\n\nLately, however, the one-two punch of high interest rates and rising Treasury yields has pummeled REITs. The first part means their costs of borrowing have gone up, in some cases, faster than they can raise rents to make up for the difference. The second part means conservative investors looking for dependable investments can seize 5% yields with little risk, giving them a better option in some cases than dividend-paying stocks. That trend has sent Realty Income's stock below $50 and to a 52-week low of $48.41.\n\nHowever, the company's financials remain solid, and at its lower share price, its yield has climbed above 6%, making the stock more attractive than ever. That means Realty Income's shares have a good chance of having a rebound that beats the overall market. At its current price, the stock's price-to-funds-from-operations (FFO) ratio is about 13.6%, compared to the NAREIT average of 15.5%.\n\nFor the first half of 2023, Realty Income reported revenue of $1.963 billion, up 21.3% year over year, and adjusted funds from operation (AFFO) of $1.322 billion, up 13.6%. The company also raised its monthly dividend from $0.255 per share to $0.2555 per share for its July distribution, bringing its streak of hikes without cuts to 103. Despite the dividend raise, because the company's AFFO also rose, the AFFO payout ratio remains a somewhat conservative 76.5%, leaving room for more increases.\n\nWith so many properties, some of its tenants are likely to struggle, but the company's portfolio occupancy rate remains high, at 99%, with only 137 properties available for lease or sale. In the first quarter, its occupancy rate was 99%, and a year ago, the occupancy rate was 98.9%."}, {"title": "Charlottesville Police investigating shooting on E Market Street - NBC 29", "date": "Sat, 14 Oct 2023 14:18:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.nbc29.com", "title": "NBC 29"}, "text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

That represents a 34% surge from a year ago, attesting to growing financial distress among US homeowners.\n\nAnd foreclosure activity appears to have been increasing steadily through 2023. September alone saw an 11% jump in foreclosure filings to 37,679, up 18% from September of last year, researchers added.\n\nMortgage lenders, meanwhile, began the foreclosure process on 68,961 properties in the US over the past quarter, up 3% from the third quarter of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat rise is partly attributed by the end of mortgage forbearance and foreclosure moratorium programs brought about during the pandemic, which were rolled back during 2021 and 2022. That exposed a number of households that have been strained financially in the post-pandemic economy, with inflation still hovering well-above the Fed's 2% target.\n\n\"Foreclosures are on the rise again this quarter, as indicated by our latest foreclosure numbers,\" ATTOM CEO Rob Barber said in a statement on Thursday. \"Even with the national economic upturn and job stability, it's evident that some homeowners are still grappling with the pandemic's financial aftermath or encountering new challenges.\"\n\nEconomists have warned that American consumers could grow even more strained over the following quarter, particularly as student loan payments resume. Making those payments could put more pressure on households' finances, especially considering that 34% of borrowers say that they not be able to make their student loan payments at all, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey.\n\nThose stressors come amid an already-precarious time in the housing market, where sales have shuddered to a near-halt as high mortgage rates push buyers and sellers to the sidelines. High rates have also contributed to the dearth of available housing inventory, which has also boosted home prices."}, {"title": "Most Vendors Don\u2019t Oppose Pedestrianizing Pike Place Market ... - The Urbanist", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 19:40:28 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.theurbanist.org", "title": "The Urbanist"}, "text": "A majority of Market vendors are open to pedestrianizing Pike Place and only around 5 of 61 vendors interviewed fully opposed the idea.\n\nGetting most vehicle traffic off the thoroughfare that is Pike Place so that pedestrians can more easily take over the space is a perennial topic of conversation in Seattle. The conventional wisdom is that while everyday residents who visit Pike Place Market may be in favor of restricting the ability of people in cars to drive right through the market along Pike Place, vendors and business owners inside the working farmers market are much less on board with the idea, and that\u2019s why the idea hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. A newly released survey completed by two University of Washington students turns that assumption on its head.\n\nTsz Him Lau and Kat Lykins, working as interns with Seattle Neighborhood Greenways, spent several days in early 2023, the slowest season for Pike Place Market traffic, conducting in-person interviews, often directly with the owners of Pike Place businesses, about the idea of restricting Pike Place itself to delivery vehicles, asking questions about loading needs and how they see the current street functioning.\n\nThe businesses they stopped at were located on every area of the Market, from the high stalls along the high traffic main arcade, to the less well-traveled areas on the lower floors. In the end, they were able to talk to nearly 70 people who have a front row seat on the current operation of the Market.\n\nVendor opinions tended to be more aligned with the general public than conventional wisdom held. A 2021 poll of Seattle voters conducted by Change Research found that 81% of respondents supported pedestrianizing Pike Place with accommodations for loading and unloading. It turns out, most vendors seem to be of the same mind.\n\nLau and Lykins\u2019 goal wasn\u2019t to create a statistically valid survey, but instead to more clearly understand vendors needs and ideas about traffic there, given the high frequency that vendor opposition is trotted out to push back on the idea of creating more people space at the Market.\n\n\u201cWe were merely there to listen to them and not chip in with our opinions about the matter,\u201d Lykins said. \u201cWe just really want to know their concerns, because their concerns are what mattered most.\u201d\n\nDrivers heading directly down Pike Place, often aided by GPS, has been a head-scratching element of Seattle\u2019s most visited tourist attraction for decades. (Stephen Fesler)\n\nOut of the 61 individual vendors and businesses that they were able to interview, only a handful \u2014 around five \u2014 were fully against the idea of moving the Market in a more pedestrian-oriented direction. \u201cIn this group of vendors, we found that they think the street works well, and they didn\u2019t see any conflicts between pedestrians and private vehicles, believing the cars add to the market\u2019s character and are needed for business purposes and bulk loads,\u201d the pair wrote in a summary of their research.\n\nOver half of the responses collected were fully behind the idea of closing the main Pike Place corridor to through traffic, while still allowing vehicle deliveries. The rest expressed reservations with how the closure could be implemented but remained open to the idea of a change. \u201cProvide flexibilities, limit cars but not all,\u201d one response noted. \u201cMarket tenants should be the only ones driving through,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cWe found that a lot of people tend to support the idea of pedestrianizing Pike Place Market, which is really surprising to us since we thought [they believed] that pedestrianization would bring fewer vehicles to the street, and that it will probably lower their income,\u201d Lau said. \u201cYeah, we were surprised by the findings, we thought that they weren\u2019t going to be in support just because of word of mouth\u2026 that\u2019s kind of what we heard, that people didn\u2019t like the idea of pedestrianization,\u201d Lykins said.\n\nThe interviews revealed that most of the concerns vendors had were not around providing access to customers in cars, but on other issues.\n\n\u201cLoading and unloading was mentioned the most by vendors as they overwhelmingly want to have a specific spot which will not be taken by private vehicles,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSome vendors mentioned that the current mix of pedestrians, delivery trucks, and private vehicles are a dangerous and chaotic situation. We heard several horror stories about market workers and customers being hit or nearly hit.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, SDOT took a plan for a curbless street on Pike Street across from the Market even further by pedestrianizing half of the block, changing the dynamic of the entire street. Similar permanent moves inside the Market have received more push back. (Ryan Packer)\n\nThe results provide daylight between Pike Place Market\u2019s frontline workers and business owners and the institutions that operate the Market day-to-day, along with the numerous institutions involved in advocating on behalf of the Market. The Pike Place Public Development Authority (PDA) is ultimately the entity with the power to move forward on any changes around the street\u2019s operation, but groups like the Pike Place Market Foundation, Friends of the Market, and the Pike Place Market Constituency will all need to be brought along as well. (Full disclosure: This reporter served on the board of Friends of the Market for several years and saw up close the knee-jerk reaction that the idea of pedestrianizing the Market receives inside those circles.)\n\nThe argument against increased pedestrianization has often boiled down to, \u201cIf it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d Peter Steinbrueck, the former city councilmember and port commissioner held in high esteem by the Market community thanks to his advocacy around preserving elements of the Market over the past few decades, wrote in an op-ed in 2022 that \u201ctraffic is actually part of the success of the Market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Market would be lessened without the traffic spine and interaction of transport and service-vehicle access which is essential to the health of the retail and accessible short-term parking,\u201d Steinbrueck added.\n\nVirtually no one is proposing to not allow deliveries or service vehicles to access Pike Place.\n\nWhile the idea of restricting vehicle access to Pike Place has percolated for years, the fact that the Market is largely self-regulated has always stopped the idea from gaining traction. (Stephen Fesler)\n\nSeattle artist and Market advocate Billy King, writing in the newsletter for the Friends of the Market early last year, offered an explanation of the reluctance of the Market\u2019s institutions to try a long-term pilot.\n\n\u201cThe idea (of a car-less Pike Place) was finally implemented a decade or more ago by the Market landlord for one month during high summer season,\u201d King wrote. \u201cThe results were a disaster for merchants in the four floors of retail below street level, known collectively as Down Under\u2026. And so quietly the results of the \u2018car free\u2019 experiment in the Pike Place Market were shelved. It turned out that cars on Pike Place served as people distributors, forcing pedestrians to take a variety of routes to wind their way through the Market.\u201d\n\nThe lower levels of the Market have never been well advertised, with many longtime Seattle residents fully unaware of some of the interesting businesses down on those floors. The city\u2019s new waterfront, which will turn the neglected back side of the Market into a second front door, could end up providing a revitalization for the Down Under all on its own, with the new Overlook Walk providing a direct route from the new public spaces at the water\u2019s edge to the elevators and stairwells that lead to the Market.\n\nIn May, a Seattle Neighborhood Greenways bike tour examined the progress at Pier 62, where the aquarium and Overlook Walk are under construction. The Overlook Walk will funnel people walking, rolling, and biking toward Pike Place Market\u2019s Down Under. (Doug Trumm)\n\nBut there might also be additional things the Market could do, like better signage, to help that effort along. The radical change to come when the waterfront project is complete suggests that the Market as a whole could be at a turning point.\n\nAs for looking to leadership from Seattle\u2019s city hall, policymakers are clearly waiting for the Market to take the lead on any potential changes.\n\n\u201cIf you travel internationally, or even through other parts of the United States, you find great examples of working markets\u2026that are largely pedestrian focused environments,\u201d Councilmember Andrew Lewis, whose district includes the Market, said at a forum in September. \u201cI don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t work effectively at Pike Place. That said, I have great respect for the institutions that make up the Pike Place Market, and I think that for this to happen, it requires the buy-in, it requires the organizing and it requires the deliberation of the historic organs of the Market that have been the policymaking bodies that have determined\u2026how the Market has evolved over the years.\u201d\n\nIf that evolution is going to be able to continue, it helps to be open and honest about what the biggest obstacles to change might be, and it\u2019s clear that at least a sizable number of Market vendors are on board with trying something new.\n\nSupport Us"}, {"title": "United Kingdom Compact Construction Equipment Market Assessment Report 2023-2029 Featuring Prominent Vendors - Caterpillar, Komatsu, Liebherr Volvo, Hitachi, JCB, Takeuchi, Kubota, Hyundai, & CNH - Yahoo Finance", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 09:03:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Finance"}, "text": "Company Logo\n\nUK Compact Construction Equipment Market\n\nUK Compact Construction Equipment Market\n\nDublin, Oct. 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"UK Compact Construction Equipment Market - Strategic Assessment & Forecast 2023-2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe U.K. compact construction equipment market is expected to account for 48,505 units by 2029 from 36,143 units in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 4.29% from 2022-2028\n\nCompact excavators dominated the U.K. compact construction equipment market in 2022, holding the largest market share. Additionally, the material handling segment, particularly in the context of compact construction equipment applications, claimed the largest share in the same year. This dominance is attributed to increasing investments in various sectors such as housing, warehouse expansion, and public infrastructure projects, which are driving demand for excavators within the U.K. compact construction equipment market.\n\nThe e-commerce and logistics industries in the U.K. have been experiencing significant growth, which, in turn, has increased the demand for warehouses. In 2022, the government's investment in warehouse expansion doubled to USD 7.9 billion, focusing on regions like the Northwest, East Midlands, and West Midlands. This growth in the logistics and e-commerce sectors is expected to have a positive impact on the demand for compact forklifts within the U.K. compact construction equipment market.\n\nIn February 2023, construction began on the new Weyburn General Hospital, which is set to bring significant developments. The new hospital will feature an Emergency Medical Services garage and an adjacent heliport, aiming to enhance patient transport safety and efficiency. Replacing the existing Weyburn General Hospital, the new facility will encompass 35 beds and have an approximate building area of 9,730 square meters.\n\nLeading players in the U.K. compact construction equipment market include Caterpillar, Volvo CE, Komatsu, JCB, Takeuchi, and Kubota. These companies hold prominent market shares and offer a wide range of compact equipment solutions. Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo CE, and JCB are among the top revenue generators in the U.K. compact construction equipment market.\n\nStory continues\n\nMARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS\n\nA Surge in Investment in the Residential Sector to Support the U.K. Compact Construction Equipment Market Growth\n\nThe government introduced an affordable housing delivery plan for 2022-2025 in Bristol City in 2021. By 2024, the project aims to build 1,000 new affordable housing units in one year. This project is an updated version of the previous housing delivery plan for 2017-2020. In addition, the government planned to invest USD 4.8 billion over five years for affordable homes in London in 2021-2026.\n\nAccording to the recent data published by the government, the Bank of England expects a slight increase in the mortgage rates in the UK, which will force housing prices to decline as borrowing will become costlier and eventually fall.\n\nInvestment in National Healthcare Plan to Prompt the Demand for Compact Excavators\n\nIn 2021, the U.K. government introduced the Health Infrastructure Plan (HIP), a five-year Programme for investment in health infrastructure, including capital to build new hospitals. In 2022, the government plans to invest more than USD 2 billion in healthcare in the next four years.\n\nThe HIP project will aim to modernize the existing ones & construct new hospitals. The government has allocated USD 542.9 million to upgrade accident and emergency departments, USD 482.6 million for improving mental health facilities, and USD 723.9 million to upgrade and refurbish National Health Service hospitals.\n\nInvestment in Renewable Energy to Reach Net Zero Emissions Is Expected to Boost the U.K. Compact Construction Equipment Market\n\nBP has planned an investment of USD 112.34 million to develop new ports, harbors, and shipyards, including constructing four ships to aid the offshore wind projects across the UK. BP has claimed to build two large-scale hydrogen production facilities (H2 Teesside & HyGreen Teesside), expected to produce 1.5GW of hydrogen by 2030.\n\nThe UK government funded USD 9 million for 24 projects under the Longer Duration Energy Storage (LODES) competition. This funding is projected to support the development of new energy storage technologies and help the U.K. transition to renewable energy sources.\n\nINDUSTRY RESTRAINTS\n\nIncreasing Construction Costs Will Harm the Sales of Compact Construction Equipment\n\n\n\nAccording to the Building Materials and Components Statistics, construction costs to create new houses increased by 4.5% from May 2022 to May 2023, and the renovation and repair costs increased by 1.2% during the same period. Further, the price of insulating materials increased by 28.8%, ready-mixed concrete by 18.7%, and fabricated structured steel by 24.2%. Other input materials such as timber, cement, plywood, and roof tiles witnessed high prices due to their limited supply.\n\n\n\nShortage of Warehouse Spacing Is Expected to Impact the Demand for Material Handling Equipment\n\n\n\nThe U.K. is expected to run out of warehouse spacing after the boom of eCommerce post-pandemic. The available warehouse spacing in the country has decreased below 50 million square feet. Telford is one of the worst affected areas in the U.K. by the warehouse space shortage, with 33,293 square feet for the 6,105 registered businesses in the area. This chronic shortage of warehouse space has seen rents rise 61%, more than twice the inflation rate.\n\n\n\nSkilled Labour Shortage in the Country to Hamper the Pace of Construction Projects\n\nIn August 2022, ONS surveyed 13.3% of the businesses witnessing labor shortage. The industries with the highest percentage of businesses experiencing worker shortages in Nov 2022 were Accommodation and food services (35.5%) and Construction (20.7%).\n\nBetween September and November 2022, there were 1.19 million vacancies across the UK.\n\nThe aging population and early retirements are other threatening causes of labor shortage in the country. In 2022, the ONS surveyed adults aged between 50 and 70 who had left the workforce since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nKEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED:\n\nHow big is the U.K. compact construction equipment market?\n\nWhat is the growth rate of the U.K. compact construction equipment market?\n\nWho are the key players in the U.K. compact construction equipment market?\n\nWhat are the trends in the U.K. compact construction equipment market?\n\nWhich are the major distributor companies in the U.K. compact construction equipment market?\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 177 Forecast Period 2022 - 2029 Estimated Market Value in 2022 36143 Units Forecasted Market Value by 2029 48505 Units Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.2% Regions Covered United Kingdom\n\nVENDOR LANDSCAPE\n\nProminent Vendors\n\nCaterpillar\n\nKomatsu\n\nLiebherr\n\nVolvo Construction Equipment\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery\n\nJCB\n\nTakeuchi Manufacturing\n\nKubota\n\nHyundai Construction Equipment\n\nCNH Industrial\n\nOther Prominent Vendors\n\nKobelco\n\nLiuGong\n\nManitou\n\nYanmar\n\nMecalac\n\nHydrema\n\nDistributor Profiles\n\nGordon Construction Equipment\n\nMolson Equipment\n\nDennis Barnfield Ltd\n\nWarwick Ward\n\nErnest Doe & Sons Ltd\n\nSMT GB\n\nSEGMENTATION ANALYSIS\n\nSegmentation by Type\n\nExcavators\n\nBackhoe Loaders\n\nWheel Loaders\n\nTrack Loaders\n\nSkid Steer Loaders\n\nTelehandlers\n\nForklifts\n\nAerial Platforms\n\nOthers\n\nSegmentation by Application\n\nMaterial Handling\n\nMaintenance & Utility Works\n\nWaste Management\n\nOthers\n\nSegmentation by End Users\n\nConstruction\n\nMining\n\nWarehouse & Logistics\n\nOthers (Power Generation, Utilities Municipal Corporations, Oil & Gas, Cargo Handling, Power Generation Plants)\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/n7h9ap\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

IT stocks dragged after Infosys and HCL Tech cut revenue outlook after the Q2 earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the global trend is also slightly negative as the US retail inflation for September at 3.7 percent came slightly higher than expected. The implication of this higher inflation trend is that the fight to bring the US inflation to the long-term target of 2 percent will take more time and, therefore, rates will remain higher for longer. This will restrain a rally in equity markets.\n\nHowever, the domestic macros have turned distinctly positive with the CPI inflation in September falling steeply to 5.02 percent and the IIP for August rising impressively to 10.3 percent. This implies that the RBI MPC can pause for the rest of FY24 and go for a rate cut in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, it is also important to keep an eye out on the rising US bond yields and the Israel-Hamas conflict. Investors hope that the Israel-Hamas conflict will remain a localised crisis that will not impact crude prices. However, they remain cautious since the situation taking a turn for the worse cannot be ruled out.\n\nFurthermore, even though FIIs are sustained sellers in the market, buying by DIIs, HNIs and retail are counterbalancing the selling and supporting the market.\n\nThe fact that Nifty is less than 3 percent away from the all-time high indicates the strength and resilience of the market.\n\nStock Market Trend\n\nThe benchmarks Nifty and Sensex declined around half a percent in intra-day deals on Friday, however, for the month of October so far, the benchmarks remain in the green, up 0.45 percent. This comes after a 2 percent gain in September.\n\nOverall in 2023 YTD, the Nifty has advanced around 9 percent, giving positive returns in 7 of the 10 months so far. The index was in the red in the first 2 months of 2023 as well as in August. It rose the most in April, up 4 percent and fell the most in August, down 2.5 percent.\n\nSince hitting its record high of 20,222.45 on September 15, 2023, Nifty has been in the green in 6 of the 18 sessions.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last 1 year, the benchmark has given double-digit returns, up 16 percent.\n\nWhat should be your strategy now? Here's what experts advise:\n\nNaveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities PMS\n\nInvestors should remain cautious but should focus on the earnings growth trajectory. Companies with strong earnings growth will continue to deliver healthy returns. Thus, quality and growth investing should be the key focus areas.\n\nThe themes that the market should explore are consumption and asset repricing themes. FY24 will see a significant uptick in election spending. This development will boost consumption spending. Asset repricing is also an important theme as plants and machinery across the board are likely to see higher valuations. The market opportunities continue to be in small and mid-sized banks, NBFCs, autos and auto ancillary space, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nNew investors should take time to build portfolios and invest in areas they understand well. During bull markets, everybody makes money, and during bear markets, only a few manage to escape unscathed. The markets will continue to see these cycles. Thus, investing in areas that they understand will help in better decision-making when the cycle turns.\n\nHemang Kapasi, Head of Equities, Sanctum Wealth\n\nThere is still a significant impetus for infrastructure building in several verticals, especially railways, roads, power, defence, and civil utilities. For the first three months of this fiscal, central government capex surged by 60 percent YoY to \u20b92.8 lakh crore. Sustained infrastructure investments shall help the capital goods, industrials, and infrastructure sectors to continue performing in the coming months.\n\nAuto and auto ancillary sectors shall also continue to see selective traction as a few sub-segments in the industry are performing extremely well and with the upcoming festive season, the momentum is expected to continue. BFSI will also be a good space for stock picking. The credit growth is sustaining at mid-double digits, which is an enabling environment for niche small and midcap lenders to grow well.\n\nWe are also positive on healthcare as a theme, which is being supported by improving healthcare infrastructure, improved demand backed by government schemes, higher insurance penetration and improving supply in tier 2 cities.\n\nCurrently, our model portfolio is fairly diversified with the highest weight in financials, followed by industrial and manufacturing, consumer discretionary, and IT. We were very positive on our top two themes in the previous year, and we continue to be positive now as well. However, as the low-hanging fruits are gone with the rally, we are trimming some positions to rebalance the portfolio and get into newer themes.\n\nApurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspective and Research, SAMCO Securities\n\nInvestors can protect their portfolios by diversifying in non-correlated assets. So if you have all your investments into equities whether large, mid, or small-cap, it won\u2019t matter much. If there is a crash in the markets, it will affect all three. But if you have allocations towards gold, silver, currency, and fixed-income securities, then the overall impact on your portfolio will be minimised.\n\nCrude oil has been racing higher and trading above the $90/ barrel mark. One should stay away from industries like aviation, tyres, and paints which have crude oil and its derivatives as an important raw material. One should also stay away from oil marketing companies as they won\u2019t have much pricing power if crude spikes higher from here given that we are heading for elections soon.\n\nAn ideal portfolio could have 60-70 percent equity allocation while the remaining portion can be spread out evenly between gold and fixed-income securities. The allocation should shift more towards gold and fixed income as we move closer to the general elections next year. Elections are bound to create some volatility in the markets which will be difficult to digest for many players. Hence, one must lower his/her exposure and wait on the sidelines for the dust to settle.\n\nShrey Jain, CEO and Founder of SAS Online\n\nNo matter if we're talking about Nifty, Bank Nifty, or any other index, the fundamental principle for achieving long-term investment success remains the same: build a diversified portfolio that matches your financial objectives and comfort with risk. Taking a long-term view, ideally over a span of 3 to 5 years, is absolutely essential. We are not far away from the end of 2023, and the market has recently reached an all-time high. However, looking ahead, it appears that we may experience a time-bound correction, consequently, it would be prudent not to expect substantial returns by the year's end.\n\n\"Exciting news!

As reported by MarketWatch\u2019s Barbara Kollmeyer, Grantham has given an interview to a Bloomberg podcast in which he made three big investment calls.\n\nThe first two are that the stock market could fall 50% from here and that investors should steer clear of U.S. stocks altogether because they are overvalued. Maybe he\u2019s right, maybe he isn\u2019t. Both are calls he\u2019s made several times in the past. Subsequent events have not always conformed to the model.\n\nBut it\u2019s Grantham\u2019s third call that is most interesting, especially to anyone trying to save enough to retire on someday.\n\nGrantham urged investors to focus on so-called high-quality stocks, which he called \u201ca free lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to quality, they have less risk of every kind, they have less debt, they go bankrupt less, they have less volatility, they have a lower beta. \u2026 That is a free lunch,\u201d he said.\n\nIs he right? History says: Almost certainly.\n\nHigh-quality stocks, typically meaning those of companies with things like high returns on equity, stable earnings and low levels of debt, have persistently been a better investment than the overall stock market for decades.\n\nAnd that\u2019s been true not only here in the U.S., but also in developed overseas markets like Europe and Japan.\n\nEven more clearly, high-quality stocks have produced their greatest successes during market downturns, crashes, bear markets and slumps. That\u2019s when they\u2019ve held up best, while the weakest stocks have tanked.\n\nNot every financial expert agrees with this, incidentally. Many question whether company quality is really any kind of reliable indicator of stock-market outperformance. There has been a trend in academia to suggest that many of these so-called investment factors are bogus, the product of data mining, p-hacking (don\u2019t ask), publication bias and other sins.\n\nOn the other hand, the number crunchers at hedge-fund company AQR have argued that quality is not only a strong source of investment returns, it\u2019s a major source of Warren Buffett\u2019s success \u2014 and $120 billion fortune.\n\nAs Buffett himself has said, he\u2019d rather buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\n\nThe proof of a free lunch, surely \u2014 like the proof of a pumpkin pie, an allegedly $5.5 billion fake-meat sandwich or pretty much anything else \u2014 is in the eating.\n\nMSCI, the organization that tracks stock-market data around the world, has been monitoring indexes of \u201cquality\u201d stocks on a price basis since the mid-1970s, and on a total return basis \u2014 meaning including dividends \u2014 since the mid-1990s.\n\nDuring the average 12-month period since 1975, looking only at the price indexes, quality stocks have beaten the overall stock market by 1.7 percentage points in the U.S., 1.3 percentage points in Europe and 0.4 points in Japan.\n\nFactoring in dividends as well, from 1994, quality stocks have beaten the overall stock market by 1.5 percentage points a year in the U.S., by 1.9 points a year in Japan and by 2 points a year in Europe.\n\nOver time, these have really added up. If you\u2019d invested $100,000 in the broad U.S. stock market in November 1994 (using the MSCI U.S.A. standard index of large and midsize companies as a proxy), reinvesting all dividends, today you\u2019d have $1.6 million before tax.\n\nBut if you\u2019d invested in high-quality U.S. stocks alone, you\u2019d have $2.7 million.\n\nIf you\u2019d invested that money in European stocks, you\u2019d have about $700,000 today. But if you\u2019d picked high-quality European stocks, you\u2019d have twice as much: $1.4 million.\n\nJapan, which has struggled with lost decades of dismal returns, still sees a similar divergence. According to MSCI data, $100,000 invested in Japan back in late 1994 would be worth just $170,000 today. But the same figure in high-quality Japanese stocks would be worth $250,000.\n\nIn MSCI\u2019s data, the outperformance of quality has been persistent, but not consistent. It has lasted over long periods of time. But it has not shown up every month, or every year. There have been several years at a time when quality stocks have done worse than the overall market. Finance is not a natural science like physics, no matter what the professors like to claim. This water does not always boil at 100 degrees Celsius at one atmosphere.\n\nFor example, U.S. quality stocks handily beat the rest of the market during the bear market of 2000-03 and during the global financial crisis of 2007-09. European quality stocks outperformed, at certain points by 10 full points a year, during the European debt crisis of 2010-13. Japan\u2019s stock market entered a brutal, long-running bear market at the start of the 1990s. But at the end of the decade, measured in U.S. dollars, Japanese quality stocks were still nearly 50% higher than they had been at the end of 1989.\n\nBut quality underperformed the overall stock market during other periods. It did badly from 2004 to 2007, when the stocks you wanted to own tended to be in doomed kamikaze companies like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Countrywide Financial.\n\nWhere are they now? Quality stocks have been beating the broader market index in the U.S. for about a year, but they have been trailing the indexes in Europe and Japan.\n\nIf Grantham is correct, we should be investing \u2014 especially if we fear a downturn ahead \u2014 in funds such as the iShares MSCI U.S.A. Quality Factor exchange-traded fund QUAL and the MSCI International Quality Factor ETF IQLT. Both have low fees, at 0.15% and 0.3% respectively. And if history is any guide, they will fall less far in a slump and will make us more money in the long term."}, {"title": "Housing market remains strong, impact ripples across to homeowners - KWCH", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 01:36:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.kwch.com", "title": "KWCH"}, "text": "WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - The price of housing keeps on an upward trend, a situation seen in Kansas and across the U.S. Data from REALTORS of South Central Kansas shows while home sales slowed some last month, the average sale price is up 7.5% over the year.\n\nConditions continue to be favorable to sellers as demand from buyers remains strong. After three years of an especially active housing market, REALTORS of South Central Kansas see inventory increasing and prices holding strong.\n\nBraden McCurdy with McCurdy Real Estate and Auction and president of REALTORS of South Central Kansas said even with higher interest rates, buyers are not shying away.\n\n\u201cRates are still really good in the climate. It\u2019s still a great time to buy. There\u2019s inventory finally coming on the market,\u201d said McCurdy.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are seeing inventory coming back up, finally. We had gotten as tight as 0.6 months supply of inventory and then today, we\u2019re sitting at 1.9 months supply of inventory, again with a balanced market being in the five to six (month) range.\u201d\n\nWhile there are fewer home sales happening, home prices continue increasing. McCurdy said it\u2019s forecasted to be about a 4.2% appreciation rate this year, a slower rate than what\u2019s recently been seen.\n\n\u201cValues continue to hold and continue to slowly appreciate. A little bit more pre-COVID application rates,\u201d McCurdy said.\n\nAll those factors that made a hot market the last few years also come into play in other ways. It\u2019s part of the factor that impacts appraised values.\n\nFor 2023, most Sedgwick County homeowners saw a 10% increase in their home\u2019s appraised value.\n\n\u201cYou had high inflation. That pushed prices,\u201d said Sedgwick County Appraiser Mark Clark. \u201cNaturally, you have a tight supply. When you have all of that happening, appraised values will increase, and they did.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOf course, age, location, square footage, remodeling and the sales prices of similar properties are the main drivers there.\u201d\n\nSedgwick County Appraiser's Office (Sedgwick County Appraiser's Office)\n\nClark discussed this topic with county commissioners last week. He said part of the reason residential properties have such a significant impact is 75 percent of parcels in Sedgwick County are residential, for a total of 182,000 parcels.\n\n\u201cIf you look at commercial, that represents roughly six percent of the parcels. That is a weaker market. The residential market is so much stronger than the commercial that you have this ramping up. That is the reason why that chart is, it\u2019s upsetting to some property owners, especially the residential. Well, look at that; it\u2019s like it\u2019s taken wings. It\u2019s flying and look at these people over here, the commercial they\u2019re going down,\u201d said Clark.\n\nKansas lawmakers are considering a constitutional amendment to cap valuation increases at 4% in a year with exceptions including for new construction and remodeling. Clark said while that idea may sound beneficial, that idea comes with drawbacks. He said that might discourage people from making property improvements, and it doesn\u2019t take into consideration if there\u2019s a downturn in the market.\n\n\u201cIf you have a number of years where property values are increasing, of course, you still have a cap, but say the economy turns sour, then there\u2019s nothing I have seen in that legislation that\u2019s sort of like a circuit breaker that says the economy has now turned sour, that four percent cap still continues. We\u2019re still going to be putting that 4% on, and maybe the market has dropped 20%. People are going to be really angry,\u201d Clark said.\n\nHe said another concern is FEMA reimbursement after a disaster. That is based on the official appraised value. Clark said a cap would lead to an artificial value, so it could mean people are reimbursed less than the property is worth.\n\nCopyright 2023 KWCH. All rights reserved.

Kinzie St. in Chicago, is seen on Aug. 6, 2023. (Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune)\n\nWeeks after opening, the property housing the buzzy new Guinness Open Gate Brewery in West Loop \u2014 already a booming tourist attraction \u2014 is set to change hands.\n\nFred Latsko, a Chicago real estate developer, has listed the building at 901 W. Kinzie St. for sale and hired the commercial brokerage firm JLL to look for a buyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatsko Interests manages properties in six states, but most of its commercial holdings are in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood. A mix of luxury and nationwide companies operate from Latsko buildings, including Lanvin, Lululemon, Citi Bank and Intermix.\n\nSix brokers from JLL have been tasked with finding a buyer for the 15,000-square-foot space, CoStar News reported. The brewery will remain operational even if the building changes hands, Irish Central reported Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile the landlord is selling the property, the business is not for sale,\u201d a Guinness Open Brewery Chicago spokesperson said. \u201cGuinness is fully committed to the space, the West Loop community and is thrilled to have had such a strong opening two weeks.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s hotly anticipated Guinness brewery was announced in 2021, and opened Sept. 28 to thirsty crowds. Twelve to 16 beers, mixing Irish specialties and local drafts, are on tap every day, alongside a full-service restaurant and bakery.\n\nGuinness has also committed to donating 10,000 loaves of bread a year to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, the Tribune previously reported.\n\nLatsko applied in April to have the area around the brewery rezoned from an industrial commercial district to a downtown mixed-use district, according to city documents.\n\nGuinness has been found on taps around the world for more than 260 years, starting with the St. James Gate Brewery in Dublin. Arthur Guinness, the company\u2019s first master brewer, famously took out a 9,000-year lease on the brewery in 1759 and began exporting the now-iconic black Guinness porter beer in 1796. Guinness is now produced at more than 50 breweries worldwide, but only Open Gate Breweries welcome the public for tours.\n\nOpen Gate Breweries also opened in Dublin in 2015 and Baltimore in 2018. As both of these locations are owned by Guinness, Latsko and JLL are pitching the Chicago brewery as a unique chance to raise a glass to private ownership, Latsko said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the torch, or in this case, the tap, to new stewardship,\u201d Latsko said in a statement.\n\nKeely Polczynski, managing director of capital markets for JLL and one of the brokers representing Latsko in the sale, declined to comment Thursday, saying that the brewery was not yet officially on the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJLL has not started contacting potential buyers and has not made projections for how much the brewery might sell for, Polczynski said.\n\nA source close to the deal told CoStar News earlier this week that brokers expect to fetch upward of $20 million for the space, previously home to the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot. The brewery will remain operational as the property changes hands.\n\nA source close to the sale said that the presence of the Guinness brewery in the space is backed by a 10-year lease, which will remain even if the building is sold.\n\nCoStar News also reported that Guinness expects to net upward of $1 million in operating income each year."}, {"title": "Heart Valve Devices Market Size & Share to Surpass $25.9 Billion by 2030 | Vantage Market Research - Yahoo Finance", "date": "Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:01:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Finance"}, "text": "Vantage Market Research, The North Star for the Working World\n\nWASHINGTON, Oct. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Heart Valve Devices Market is valued at USD 8.9 Billion in 2022 and is expected to reach USD 25.9 Billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 14.3% over the forecast period 2023-2030.\n\n\n\nOverview of the Heart Valve Devices Market\n\nThe heart valve devices market is a crucial segment of the healthcare industry, aimed at providing innovative solutions for patients with heart valve disorders.

Read more\n\nAfter being paused for four years because of the pandemic, the Y\u00e8Sh\u00ec Chinatown Night Market will be returning Thursday.\n\nThe market, founded by the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC) in 2011, used to be held every year, attracting more than 20,000 people, on average. But once the pandemic hit, the market shut down \u2014 until community members decided to bring it back this year.\n\nSince its founding, the Y\u00e8Sh\u00ec Chinatown Night Market has been an ode to Chinese culture and tradition.\n\n\u201cThe idea of having a night market is something that originates from China,\u201d said Haoyi Shang, commercial corridor manager for PCDC and one of the organizers of the night market. Shang said that Rachel Mak, deputy director of PCDC, felt inspired to organize the market after her trips to China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place where everyone around the city comes \u2014 no matter what ethnicity, race you are \u2014 to just enjoy great food and great entertainment.\u201d Anna Quan\n\n\u201c[Mak] saw a very lively night market scene in Hong Kong and other places in China, and she said we should have something similar in Chinatown,\u201d Shang said.\n\nFor Anna Quan, another organizer of the event, the Y\u00e8Sh\u00ec Night Market has been a staple throughout her upbringing in Chinatown \u2014 and a way for her to connect with her heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt really does bring a lot of the Asian culture \u2026 and it\u2019s a place where everyone around the city comes \u2014 no matter what ethnicity, race you are \u2014 to just enjoy great food and great entertainment,\u201d Quan said. \u201cI think it also empowers the Chinatown community as well, to be able to showcase different businesses and food trucks within the city.\u201d\n\nShang added that they hope the night market will attract non-Chinatown residents to view the neighborhood as a destination and a safe area to visit at night.\n\nLocated on 10th and Race Streets in Chinatown, the night market will feature a diversity of food vendors, arts and crafts vendors, performances, and activities. Food will include Korea Taqueria, Byzantium Empire, Sang Lee Noodle House, and Husky Jaws Corn Roasting Co.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Community members rallied to keep Kingsessing Rec\u2019s basketball courts open.

But Chinatown community members and supporters say the arena would cause gentrification and displacement in the historic neighborhood, one of the last remaining communities of color in Center City.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our main focus at the beginning\u2026 but at this point, we realized that\u2019s an ongoing issue that\u2019s going to impact our community deeply,\u201d Shang said.\n\nThe Y\u00e8Sh\u00ec Chinatown Night Market will be held Thursday, Oct. 12 from 6 to 10 p.m., from Arch and 10th Streets up north to Race Street between 11th and 9th Streets."}, {"title": "Wrong-way 18-wheeler caused fatal I-83 crash at Market Street: Police - York Dispatch", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:37:30 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.yorkdispatch.com", "title": "York Dispatch"}, "text": "Wrong-way 18-wheeler caused fatal I-83 crash at Market Street: Police\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Sights and sounds of 2023 Hocus Poke-Us at York Fairgrounds Hocus Poke-Us flash tattoo and piercing event took place Saturday and Sunday in the horticulture building of the York Fairgrounds.\n\nOne person is dead after an 18-wheeler going the wrong way on Interstate 83 collided with another vehicle early Monday morning at the Market Street interchange.\n\nThe crash happened in the southbound lanes, according to the York County Coroner's Office, with the coroner's office called to the scene at 2:52 a.m.\n\nPennsylvania State Police, who investigated the crash, said the driver of a tractor-trailer attempted to enter the interstate by heading north on the southbound off ramp against traffic.\n\n>> Please consider subscribing to support local journalism.\n\nThe driver of the second vehicle was heading south on the interstate when he crashed into the 18-wheeler.

Tesla and Meta Platforms now have market capitalizations of less then $1 trillion, but have passed that milestone previously, while Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet have been consistently above $1 trillion for years now. These dynamic technology stocks have crushed the market in recent years, providing life-changing returns for many of their long-term investors.\n\nBut what about the next stock that might join the trillion-dollar club? This is perhaps a more valuable question for investors to consider. You don't make money owning a stock based on what it has done in the past. I think payments network operator Visa (V 1.01%) is the most likely company to join the trillion-dollar market cap club within the next few years. Here's why.\n\nDominant competitive position, industry tailwinds\n\nVisa operates the leading credit card and digital payments network around the world, processing $14.1 trillion in transaction volume in its fiscal 2022. It currently has more than 4 billion credit and debit cards in circulation. Because it is only a payments network, not a credit card issuer, Visa earns tiny fees on every payment transaction made through its network, but it takes minimal lending risks.\n\nWith around a 40% market share of global credit card transactions, Visa has a competitive advantage that's nearly insurmountable, which should keep it insulated from any upstart networks. According to the company, more than 100 million merchant locations accept Visa cards. Merchants are unlikely to add a raft of new payment options for their customers unless they love wasting time and confusing shoppers. They generally choose to accept Visa because of its ubiquity. And consumers and banks favor it because they know virtually every merchant in the world will accept a Visa card.\n\nCashless forms of payment have multiple tailwinds that Visa should be able to ride for the foreseeable future. Most important is the steady transition of consumer activity away from physical cash. More and more people around the globe are using credit cards and mobile phone apps to pay for things, which means more payments flowing through the Visa network. The company also benefits from inflation as it earns a percentage on every dollar processed through the Visa network. If inflation is 3% a year and Visa maintains its market share, that will add about 3% to its annual revenue growth.\n\nThe math behind a $1 trillion valuation\n\nOutside of periods of market frothiness, high-quality businesses of Visa's caliber typically trade at price-to-earnings ratios in the 25 to 30 range. Today, Visa trades at the top of that range. It has a market cap of $493 billion, so it would need to roughly double to breach the $1 trillion threshold.\n\nLet's assume Visa will trade at about the same earnings ratio in the coming years as it does today. That means it would need to double its net income to join the trillion-dollar market cap club. I think it can do so in five years.\n\nHow? First, I predict that it will be able to increase revenue at about 10% annually as it rides the transition to digital payments and benefits from global inflation. Second, with close to 100% incremental margins on new revenue, Visa has incredible operating leverage. That should lead to margin expansion as it grows. Today, its operating margin is an impressive 67%, but there is still room for it to go higher.\n\nWith a combination of 10% annualized revenue growth and margin expansion, Visa could grow its bottom line by 15% per annum. At that pace, it would double its earnings in five years. Considering that most companies outside of the big tech realm are far away from a trillion-dollar market cap, I think this gives Visa a good chance at being the next company to hit that milestone.\n\nWho could beat Visa?\n\nVisa is currently the 11th-largest company in the world by market cap. Two stocks ahead of it that haven't crossed the $1 trillion mark yet are the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Warren Buffett's diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nI wouldn't be too afraid of Berkshire Hathaway getting there first, because it focuses on slower growing, steady value investments. Eli Lilly could be a wild card as sales of its new weight-loss drugs are growing like gangbusters and are projected to hit $100 billion annually by 2035. However, it does trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 80, which gives it much more downside risk than Visa.\n\nAnother strong candidate is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which has a market cap slightly lower than Visa's. The leading third-party computer chip foundry is growing quickly and has huge industry tailwinds at its back. As long as geopolitical threats from China don't kill the business, there's a possibility it will beat Visa to the $ trillion milestone. But the geopolitical risks are real for Taiwan Semi, which leads me to think Visa has a better chance of crossing the threshold first.\n\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't matter if Visa is the next company to join the trillion-dollar market cap club. All that matters to shareholders is whether Visa is increasing its earnings per share and building value.

David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the middle of West Street, a one-block stretch between the Boston Common and Downtown Crossing\u2019s main drag, sit two conjoined, nondescript buildings that encapsulate the current struggles of the downtown office market.\n\nThe pair of office buildings at 33-41 West St. \u2014 one five stories with a dingy white facade, the other, eight floors of red brick \u2014 are about half full, like the street itself, with empty lots and buildings surrounding a dormitory for Suffolk University, nonprofit and union offices. Shoppers meander through the $1, $3, and $5 outdoor racks at Brattle Book Shop; a few lots down, a developer has proposed turning a surface parking lot into a hotel.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSeven years ago, this pair sold for $16 million; late last month, they fetched just a quarter of that at $4.1 million \u2014 a warning of the possible distress facing much of the city\u2019s older, less full office stock.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no secret right now: the office market is challenging,\u201d said Mai Luo, a local real estate executive who bought the West Street buildings. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m optimistic for the future.\u201d\n\nLuo, president of boutique real estate investment firm Kendall Capital in Boston, said in an interview he\u2019s considering all options, from keeping the property as is, to examining whether a conversion to housing through the city\u2019s office-to-residential pilot program would work. (The pilot opens for a short period this fall.)\n\nThe property is 52 percent leased, Luo said. The $4.1 million deal was financed with funding from private local investors and brokered by Boston Realty Advisors.\n\nWhen Bay Management Corp., a real estate firm with offices in Dedham and New York, bought the property in 2016, the $16 million purchase was more than double its previous sale price. Bay Management Corp. did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nWhile a 74 percent decline in value is a tough figure to grapple with, experts say it\u2019s not necessarily reflective of the office market as a whole. At only half full, the property likely isn\u2019t generating much rent, said Aaron Jodka, director of research for US capital markets with brokerage Colliers International, and such \u201cnonperforming\u201d properties are valued differently than a fully leased building with cash coming in.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the underlying performance of an asset when comparing a recent sale to a prior sale,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the more befuddling elements of Boston\u2019s COVID recovery is the dual tracks of much of the city\u2019s commercial real estate market: Some buildings are benefitting from a \u201cflight to quality,\u201d with companies deciding to move to newly constructed or renovated space, while others \u2014 especially older properties that haven\u2019t seen much investment \u2014 are struggling with record availability and sublease space.\n\nFew office buildings have sold in Greater Boston since the once-hot commercial real estate market entered a deep freeze during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and experts are watching the few that do closely. Two transactions over the summer caught the industry\u2019s eye: the $45 million sale of One Liberty Square in the Financial District, at a 17 percent loss compared with its prior sale in 2013, and the $41 million sale of 70 Federal St., for an 8 percent gain since 2016. The 70 Federal deal, which closed in August, was the first office sale in downtown Boston in 18 months.\n\nNeither sale presented as stark a picture as a nearly three-quarters discount for a property in the heart of downtown, half a block from the Park Street MBTA station. Jodka views the three deals on a spectrum, with the half-full West Street on the far end of a swinging pendulum.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cIt is an indicator of a subset of buildings, but that\u2019s not the norm in Boston,\u201d Jodka said. \u201cThis is not to say that you should expect values to be off 75 percent \u2026 for the broader market. That\u2019s asset-specific.\u201d\n\nOne inescapable factor weighing on the market is an ongoing run of high interest rates. Most sales involve some form of debt or loan, and higher interest rates mean far higher debt payments for a buyer, said Phil Mobley, the national director of office analytics for real estate research firm CoStar in Boston.\n\nA sign in a window at 41 West St. tells the story. DAVID L. RYAN/GLOBE STAFF\n\nThen there\u2019s softer demand in a world where hybrid work is far more common than it was just a few years ago. Gone are the days when growing companies would lease extra space when they could in anticipation of future growth. Now, tenants are assessing how they actually use the space \u2014 and how much space they actually need.\n\n\u201cThere is much more attention being paid to both the quantity and quality of office space,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cWhen you realize you don\u2019t need as much, you can take that same amount of (investment) and put it toward nicer space.\u201d\n\nAmong big cities in the United States, Boston\u2019s central business district office market suffered the \u201cgreatest deterioration\u201d in the third quarter compared with earlier in the year, according to a report from Moody\u2019s Investors Service that measures stress in the commercial real estate market. That quarterly decrease was largely driven by a downturn in demand, along with increasing vacancy rates, the report said.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nEven so, Boston\u2019s office vacancy rate ranks among the lowest of major US markets, said Darrell Wheeler, heads of CMBS research at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The city\u2019s strong employment base and diverse economy give Boston more resiliency than other large markets, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still going to figure out how hybrid works over the next three or four years, I expect. It\u2019s a real experiment with most companies,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cAnd so, where will you be, and how carefully do tax assessments actually follow the value of these assets? It\u2019s hard to say.\u201d\n\nStill, the prospect of a commercial tax base that\u2019s deteriorating in value is worrisome when considering that about 72 percent of the city\u2019s operating revenue comes from property taxes \u2014 much of it commercial. At a City Council hearing last week, Councilor Michael Flaherty expressed concern about the impact of increasing vacancy rates \u2014 and the decline in real estate values that would likely follow \u2014 on city revenues.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we pay for our schools. That\u2019s how we pay for our parks, and our playgrounds, and our police department, and our fire department, and public works, snow plowing, tree pruning, snow removal, trash collection, all of it,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cThat\u2019s how Boston ticks.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a warning, he said. If property taxes start to fall\u2026 \u201cthat\u2019s a holy-bleep moment for Boston.\u201d"}, {"title": "PC Market Shrinks in Q3, But Shows Signs of Recovery: Report - Tom's Hardware", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 13:40:44 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.tomshardware.com", "title": "Tom's Hardware"}, "text": "International Data Corp.

Dell secured the third spot with 10.3 million PCs, but its shipments declined by 14.3% YoY. This decline was primarily due to a decrease in enterprise PC demand, particularly in the U.S., a segment where Dell has a substantial footprint.\n\nAmong the top PC vendors, Apple faced the most significant significant setback. Apple, which retailed its No. 4 position, sold 7.2 million units, a 23.1% decline from the same quarter a year ago. This was attributed to production interruptions in late 2021 \u2013 early 2022 due to COVID-related issues and subsequent recovery in Q3 2022, which created an unfavorable year-over-year comparison.

As with the COVID-19 pandemic, isolated infection threats can become a global catastrophe if not handled and quickly disclosed. With the threat of climate change, the chance of locally transmitted illnesses reappearing has increased. The unnecessary and avoidable use of antibiotics and other treatments leads to new strains of viruses, bacteria, and other diseases becoming increasingly resistant to the current vaccinations and medications. Additionally, individuals are becoming more susceptible to animal viruses because they can now infect humans due to increased meat consumption and exotic meat. Increased risk from climate change, rapid growth, globalisation, pathogenic variables, and other human factors have increased the prevalence of infectious diseases. The rise in infectious diseases will result in an expansion of the lateral flow tests market globally.\n\n\n\nOpportunity: The application of the lateral flow assay is changing\n\n\n\nOver the past 20 years, the lateral flow test has undergone rapid modification. It is currently routinely utilised at the point of care and for diagnostics. Capillary flow and nitrocellulose film can be used to create lateral flow assays. The lateral flow assay is used in point-of-care (POC), prenatal testing, and the detection of infectious illnesses. Instruments for lateral flow assays are available for application in the pharmaceutical, veterinary, food, industrial, and membrane industries.

Morgan Suggests 2 Stocks to Buy \u2014 Including One With 80% Upside - Yahoo Finance", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 23:45:08 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Finance"}, "text": "After most of the year saw the stock market on the rise, the markets are going through a volatile period. J.P. Morgan\u2019s U.S. Head of Investment Strategy Jacob Manoukian claims each such period has its own unique character and this one has been defined by U.S. Treasury yields. Last week, interest rates on 10-year U.S. government debt climbed to 4.88%, amounting to a 16-year high, before pulling back to 4.65%.\n\n\u201cTreasury yields are like the foundation that the rest of financial markets are built on,\u201d says Manoukian. \u201cWhen the foundation is shaking, it is hard for other segments to find their footing.\u201d\n\nThe result has been a sell-off period, but where some see only pain in the pullback, Manoukian makes the case there\u2019s \u201cgood value in the market now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarnings expectations are still climbing, while the drawdown has brought valuations back in line with the 10-year average level. From here, we think earnings season, positive seasonal trends and stabilizing bond yields will help equities start to rally again. Looking out, we think the chances are better than not that the S&P 500 makes a new all-time high by the middle of next year due to decent earnings growth and valuation expansion as inflation fades further,\u201d Manoukian opined.\n\nSo, with that positive outlook in tow, the question is, which equities should investors be loading up on at present? The analysts at JPMorgan have been busy seeking them out and have homed in on two stocks they see as primed to take off, including one with 80% upside. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals (APLS)\n\nThe first stock on our JPMorgan-backed list is Apellis Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm operating at both the commercial and clinical stages. The company is developing new therapeutic agents, \u2018first new class of complement medicine in 15 years,\u2019 that act through the C3 pathway, the complement system of the larger immune system. The complement cascade, which starts with the C3 protein, clears damaged cells and pathogens out the body, and when it becomes overactive it causes disease conditions through the destruction of healthy cells and tissues.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s focus is on diseases of the retina and nervous system that have high unmet medical needs \u2013 that is, there are few or no effective treatment options available. Apellis is targeting the C3 pathway as a therapeutic starting point, and has a wide-ranging project pipeline. The company\u2019s research is heavy on the pre-clinical development stages, but also has two drugs approved and on the market for commercialization, as well as several late-stage clinical trials.\n\nApellis\u2019 approved drugs are two different formulations of pegcetacoplan. Empaveli, the company\u2019s first drug on the market, is a treatment for adults suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and was approved in May of 2021. In 2022, the first full year that the drug was available for patients, Apellis realized $65.1 million in net product revenues from its US sales.\n\nThe second commercial-stage drug is syfovre, another pegcetacoplan injection formulation. This one is used to treat geographic atrophy (GA), a severe retinal condition that leads to blindness. Syfovre was approved in February of this year, and showed early success in the marketplace. There were serious concerns during the summer, however, over the occurrence of eye inflammation as a side effect. The stock plunged as far as 71% when the concerns were raised, but has since begun a modest rebound. Analysts have noted that similar drugs also showed vasculitis as a side effect, and that syfovre has shown a less severe incidence that other approved drugs.\n\nIn a recent piece of good news, for Apellis and syfovre, early Q3 sales data for syfovre were better than expected, anticipated to reach $74 million, easily exceeding the $51 million consensus estimate.\n\nStrong sales data were only one part of JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama\u2019s upgrade on APLS shares, from Neutral to Overweight (i.e., Buy). Rama is upbeat on the overall potential of pegcetacoplan, and writes, \u201cWe believe Apellis\u2019 lead asset, pegcetacoplan, represents a differentiated asset in the complement space, with opportunities in a broad range of ophthalmology, hematology, neurology, and nephrology indications. With the recent approvals of Syfovre in GA and Empaveli in PNH, the company has made strong progress on the overall pipeline. Indeed, we view Syfovre as a ~$3B peak potential drug, even with conservative assumptions.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Rama does not ignore the concerns regarding syfovre, but believes that the drug will prove successful in the long run: \u201cOf note, the company does need to work through physician perception of Syfovre, given recent disclosures of cases of retinal vasculitis and this could take time (there is risk of disclosure of additional headline with more cases). That said, physicians continue to use the product driven growth and we anticipate a fundamental and sentiment shift driving upside in APLS shares.\u201d\n\nThese comments back up Rama\u2019s $81 price target on APLS, which implies a robust one-year upside potential of ~82% for the stock. (To watch Rama\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe general Wall Street sentiment here is also bullish, as shown by the 14 recent analyst reviews \u2013 which include 12 Buys and 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $44.40, and its $68.17 average price target suggests it will gain 53% in the next 12 months. (See APLS stock forecast)\n\nLive Oak Bancshares (LOB)\n\nThe second stock we\u2019ll look at is Live Oak Bancshares, a holding company and owner of the Live Oak Bank. Live Oak is a North Carolina-based bank with a focus on the small-business loan market, particularly loans backed up by the US government through the Small Business Administration. In fact, per data from fiscal year 2022, Live Oak was the nation\u2019s largest SBA loan administrator, counting by dollar volume.\n\nOn the operational end, Live Oak is a cloud-based digital bank offering services in all 50 states. The bank\u2019s customer base is primarily composed of small businesses, but the company also offers personal banking services to individual customers. Banking services include high-yield savings accounts and CDs, as well as online and mobile access \u2013 all without online or monthly banking fees. Accounts with Live Oak are insured through the FDIC.\n\nLooking at performance, Live Oak brought in $108.46 million in revenues in 2Q23, the last reported quarter, surpassing the forecast by $1.4 million. At the company\u2019s bottom line, Live Oak reported an EPS of 39 cents per diluted share, coming in 7 cents ahead of the estimates.\n\nLooking ahead to the 3Q23 results, consensus is calling for revenues of $116.3 million and an EPS of 48 cents per share.\n\nShares in Live Oak hit a peak in August of this year, and have since fallen by more than 24%. However, JPMorgan Steven Alexopoulos believes the pullback could be the right time for investors to hop onboard.\n\n\u201cThe recent sell-off provides us with the entry point that we were waiting for. While LOB shares have underperformed over the past month in response to a rising 10-year yield, not only do we see a rising 10-year yield as providing a tailwind to the bank sector and LOB, but what\u2019s more is that for LOB specifically, we see several near-term catalysts lined up to drive the stock toward our $40 price target,\u201d Alexopoulos opined.\n\nGetting into some of Live Oak\u2019s particular strengths, Alexopoulos wrote, \u201cWith Live Oak marrying (1) an industry vertical approach, (2) its tech savviness, and (3) differentiated service culture, we see Live Oak being positioned to lead the peer group in the metrics that have been associated with outperformance. Coupling this with the valuation of the stock having come in materially, we upgrade LOB shares to Overweight.\u201d\n\nAlexopoulos\u2019 Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating comes along with a $40 price target that suggests the stock will appreciate by 37% in the year ahead. (To watch Alexopoulos\u2019 track record, click here)\n\nOverall, LOB shares hold a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split among the Street\u2019s analysts \u2013 2 to Buy and 2 to Hold. The stock is trading for $29.13 and its $36.25 average price target implies an upside potential of 24% on the one-year time frame.

Competition is the backbone of a market economy; it supports lower prices, higher quality goods and services, greater variety, and more innovation. Accordingly, President Biden has pushed for a whole-of-government approach to identify and address barriers to healthy competition wherever they appear, starting with an Executive Order in the early months of the Administration, which created the White House Competition Council and identified 72 actions agencies could take to increase competition.\n\nAs the Biden-Harris Administration implements its Investing in America agenda, which includes the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, there is a pivotal role for attention to competition. Just as regulations shape competition in existing markets, regulation and government investment can shape new and developing markets as well. By considering the promotion of competition in our investments, we can shape industries to be pro-competitive from the beginning so that there is no need to \u201cunscramble the eggs\u201d\u2014to unwind highly concentrated industries after the fact. Similarly, the economic literature shows how industrial policies that foster competition and invest in strategic industries\u2014while also \u201cweeding out\u201d projects that fail\u2014can support economic growth. A robust competition policy complements our historic investments in America to develop mature, innovative industries that are competitive on a global scale.\n\nTo this end, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released new guidance yesterday to help agencies developing Federal regulations better assess their potential effects on competition. In light of OMB\u2019s new guidance, this blog describes the central role for competition in industrial strategy and how regulation can help shape fair and resilient markets for critical goods.\n\nCompetition and Industrial Strategy\n\nThe pillars of Bidenomics work together: for example, investments in America are designed to be pro-competitive, and pro-competitive policies are designed to support investment. Through his Investing in America agenda, the President is investing in new and rapidly growing industries, including the domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies and semiconductors, and working to ensure those markets are competitive and fair.\n\nPromoting healthy competition in these industries is best accomplished by proactively shaping markets to be fair from the outset. Anticompetitive markets dominated by a few (or one single firm) can stifle innovation and prevent good ideas and products from reaching the market. On the other hand, the use of pro-competitive policies to shape markets\u2014for instance, enabling market entry by innovative new enterprises or facilitating competition between firms to constantly improve\u2014helps to maximize the benefits from the President\u2019s investments in foundation infrastructure and strategic industries.\n\nMaking sure that larger competitors do not wall off key infrastructure is vital for promoting competition, and for allowing smaller entrants to eventually scale. The Investing in America agenda supports infrastructure investment, which is essential for maintaining competition in the economy. For example, investments in airports, bridges, and municipal bus fleets, such as those included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, are important for enabling competitive industries here at home. These projects ensure that goods and services can be transported efficiently, which lowers costs and encourages new suppliers to enter the market.\n\nThe Administration is empowering the market to identify the most efficient clean energy technology for every application, rather than investing in one or two technologies or picking specific \u201cnational champion\u201d firms. Many of the Administration\u2019s investments in the Investing in America agenda are sector-based, meaning they invest in specific needs of the economy rather than individual companies or technologies. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit allow electricity production from a multitude of different clean energy sources. Starting in January 2025, any energy project that produces zero greenhouse gas emissions is eligible for the credit, whether using wind, solar, hydroelectric, or some other energy source. Tax credits like these are powerful tools in part because they do not pick winners within an industry. Unlike industrial targeting and other distortive economic policies and practices, such as those from the Chinese government, they allow consumers to make the ultimate choices while encouraging manufacturers to compete against one another. More competitive U.S. manufacturers also means that consumers around the world have more options to choose from.\n\nIn other cases, the goal of the Administration\u2019s investments is to solve coordination problems. Case in point: in order to build the capacity to deliver the clean energy the United States needs, the Investing in America agenda seeks to create new regional clean energy hubs. Companies in the same industry or supply chain often cluster in local areas and cities. For example, many auto parts manufacturers are located near final auto assembly plants. These arrangements not only lower transportation costs, but also actively encourage entry by new firms, who have an easier time accessing customers and input suppliers. For new industries, however, it may be difficult for the private sector to arrange such clusters on its own due to a classic \u201cchicken-and-egg\u201d problem: the cluster is necessary for a variety of firms to succeed, but each party needs the others to establish themselves first. Government investment can help coordinate the creation of hubs to overcome these challenges, and additional bonuses for projects using domestically-manufactured inputs or located in energy communities can further incentivize these clusters.\n\nCompetition and Regulatory Policy\n\nSimultaneously, the Administration is seeking to ensure that regulations complement the Administration\u2019s investments and support fair and resilient markets.\n\nRegulations can enhance competition. Earlier this year, the Federal Highway Administration outlined standards for electric vehicle chargers funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including requirements that the chargers have consistent plug types and power levels. Additionally, digital applications that support these charging stations must list the location, price, availability, and accessibility of chargers on a map, with a single app and account that must work for all chargers. These standards support fair competition in the electric vehicle market by enabling consumers to make choices based on the quality and price of the vehicle, not based on access to proprietary charging networks.\n\nOMB\u2019s new guidance provides regulators with resources for considering competition effects when designing and evaluating new regulations. Federal agencies have long been required to assess the benefits and costs of certain proposed regulations to ensure that they serve the public interest. The new guidance on competition, which elaborates on existing guidance,[1] encourages regulators to consider important questions such as how competitive the regulated market already is, whether new regulation would affect the number of firms in the market, and how the regulation could affect competition in the labor market.\n\nThe goal of the new guidance is not to overemphasize potential effects on competition, but rather to promote a baseline understanding regarding how and when these effects can emerge. Agencies can then apply their own extensive expertise to assess the relevance and importance of these potential competitive effects to a given proposed rule.\n\nConclusion\n\nPromoting competition is essential for ensuring effective implementation of the President\u2019s economic agenda. In tandem with historic private-sector investments in America, agency rulemaking will play a critical role in shaping new markets. This new guidance provides Federal agencies with a toolkit for evaluating how proposed regulations may impact the competitive nature of a market\u2014ensuring that the regulatory review process is informed by the best economic evidence.\n\nBy supporting agencies in considering the potential competitive effects of these rules, the new guidance helps to ensure that every investment made in the economy generates the maximum benefit for all Americans.\n\n[1] The central guidance for analyzing the benefits and costs of regulations, known as Circular A-4, is currently under revision for the first time since it was written in 2003."}, {"title": "In-securities: What Happens When Investors in an Important Market ... - SEC.gov", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 20:16:01 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.sec.gov", "title": "SEC.gov"}, "text": "Washington D.C.\n\nThank you, Emily, for your kind introduction. I\u2019m grateful to you and the Center for American Progress for organizing the event, as well as for the invitation to speak to you today. The topic of the event is timely. Private markets are an increasingly large portion of the overall markets. That means solutions to any of the most important issues in the markets today will naturally require consideration of the private markets and the assets that trade in them.\n\nBefore I begin, I need to give my standard disclaimer: I speak today in my official capacity as a Commissioner of the SEC, but this speech does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the other Commissioners, or members of the staff.\n\nI remember my first few days in private practice. Before joining my firm, I had intended to practice criminal law, not securities law. The learning curve was steep at first. Though I had learned about materiality and the basics of the public offering process, there is a lot you do not learn in law school. The acronyms alone could take years to master. After meetings, I sometimes found myself searching through rule text, academic articles and the Internet to glean context and background on questions or ideas we had discussed.\n\nThings obviously get more familiar with every new experience. And the more I practiced, the more my research delved into complex and nuanced questions. But I\u2019ve found that even as my knowledge base has grown, there will always be questions I don\u2019t know the answer to, areas I don\u2019t know as well as others, and issues I find confusing. Sometimes, this is because the words themselves seem to bear little resemblance to what they are describing.\n\nFor example, I spent much of my time in private practice litigating issues that had arisen in securities offerings, with plaintiffs alleging misconduct by one of the participants in the offering. Even when these were termed \u201cprivate\u201d offerings, I found that they were often sold to hundreds of different investors, often with little financial experience, and none of whom had any relationship with the company in which they were investing. I confess that this still does not make a lot of sense to me, and I have recently spoken on the topic.[1]\n\nLikewise, I knew what a bank was \u2014 or, I thought I did \u2014 but in the aftermath of the global financial crisis we also began to hear more and more about \u201cshadow banks.\u201d These non-bank entities engaged in many activities associated with the traditional banking system and thus posed similar spillover risks as depository banks.\n\nShadow banks function by intermediating between borrowers and investors in capital markets, but they had structured themselves in ways that allowed them to evade many of the regulations designed to prevent banks from posing undue risks to the financial system.[2] The resultant lack of oversight was a principal cause of the crisis.[3] As with private offerings, I have also spoken about this topic recently. I believe that as industries become larger, it is important to reevaluate the regulatory framework to ensure it remains fit for its purpose, and allowing parts of the financial system to operate in the shadows creates risks to investors and the financial system.[4]\n\nAnd this brings me to today \u2014 I am growing increasingly concerned with \u201cloans\u201d that look less and less like loans. The syndicated loan market has grown vastly larger in recent years and the loans themselves are far different from traditional loans. Many are sold to hundreds of \u201cpassive\u201d investors. They trade frequently and on standardized documentation. And they are used to conduct activities far beyond traditional borrowing to buy a piece of machinery or a new building.\n\nDespite this significant growth, much of this market is not subject to meaningful regulation and investors are being put at risk. In addition, I am concerned that systemic financial issues are lurking in the market, and that if these instruments are not monitored more closely, the risk to the financial system itself will continue to grow.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nExactly where this story begins is hard to pin down. We are all familiar with the idea of lending memorialized in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d That film is certainly an easy place to think of as a starting point \u2014 customers obtained loans from a particular bank, and those loans were made using the deposits at that bank. But as the economy grew and capital needs increased, the business of lending began to shift. Banks kept lending, but more often shared the risk of large transactions with other banks as part of a syndicate. This allowed banks to maintain relationships with their customer rather than losing that customer to the bond market, but not to take on the entire credit risk on their own.\n\nOver time, the link back to \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d has grown more attenuated. Banks or groups of banks originate loans but quickly syndicate nearly all of the risk to others, either as a participation (meaning the other party\u2019s relationship is only with the bank, not to the underlying borrower) or an assignment (meaning the assignee has direct contractual privity with the borrower).\n\nSyndications, loan participations, and assignments are not new. But whereas in previous decades they were small scale and bespoke \u2014 with banks selling interests to a small circle of highly sophisticated institutional investors, often other banks \u2014 these practices are now supersized and systematized. We are now a far cry from banks negotiating participations or assignments of one large loan directly, and only with a handful of peers.\n\nInstead, investment banks and other financial institutions have become dominant players. These global institutions source loans from other banks and, increasingly, shadow banks and market them to a range of investors.[5]\n\nFrequently, those investors are institutions like registered investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, collateralized loan obligations (\u201cCLOs\u201d), or other financial institutions that have large sums of money to deploy but do not have the customer relationships to make loans directly. Helpfully for these counterparties, they are not subject to bank capital regulations. One commentator called this a \u201csymbiotic arbitrage,\u201d with banks arranging loans they are not able to hold on their own books, but instead sell to institutional purchasers.[6]\n\nSome of these changes were due to regulatory developments. For instance, discussions of this trend frequently note that the Basel framework\u2019s risk-based capital rules pushed banks to diversify their portfolios to make them safer, and that this in turn led to banks holding less of any particular loan on their own books.[7] The impacts of the Basel framework and its successors have undoubtedly been positive overall, and have contributed to a safer, more resilient banking system. But the downsides of the originate-to-distribute model\u2014 the same model that came to grief with respect to mortgages and triggered the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 \u2014 have become more apparent over time.\n\nCracks Begin to Develop\n\nAs the industry approach to loan syndication continued to develop, so too did misconduct in these largely unregulated corners of the market. As I mentioned a moment ago, the market and practices of loan syndication began to change dramatically. Driven in part by pressures to compete against investment banks that were able to place short term commercial paper, banks began to market loan participations to their institutional clients.[8] These new structures did not create any relationship with the borrower through which an investor could enforce its claim. They also did not provide a mechanism for investors to conduct their own diligence or information gathering.\n\nInstead, investors were entirely dependent on the efforts of the intermediary bank, which frequently retained little or no risk. The practical result of this structure was to leave investors with no recourse against any party to the transaction, even in the case of intentional misconduct.[9] The results were sadly all too predictable. Certain companies were not able to make good on their debts and defaulted, leaving investors holding the bag with little to no recourse.\n\nFor example, in a case in the late 1980s, a California bank marketed participations in loans it had made to a large company called Integrated Resources. The bank\u2019s marketing efforts involved conduct reminiscent of boiler room scams. This included daily cold calls to market the notes to investors who had neither the means nor the ability to conduct diligence on the company. These participations were marketed as investments and looked like securities. Investors, relying on publicly available information, purchased them as yield-enhancing alternatives to money-market investments.[10] There was no other risk-reducing regulatory framework as the investors were not in privity with the underlying borrower and thus had no ability to sue it directly.[11]\n\nBut in Banco Espanol de Credito v. Security Pacific National Bank, the Second Circuit ruled that the investments in loan participations were not, in fact securities, and dismissed the investors\u2019 claims.[12] The Banco Espanol opinion applied the four-part test in Reves v. Ernst & Young, which starts with the presumption that an instrument described as a note is a security, but then applies four factors to determine whether the note bears \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d to another instrument which is not a security and, if so, treats the instrument similarly.[13]\n\nEven in 1992, when the Banco Espanol opinion came down, it was clear that the opinion\u2014which has been variously described by some critics as \u201cpuzzling,\u201d \u201crelatively cursory,\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d\u2014 was meant to be narrow. The Second Circuit retreated from it almost immediately (at least in part).[14] For example, when it denied a petition for rehearing, the court narrowed the scope of its original decision to emphasize that it only ruled with respect to the particular loan participations before it, and it also emphasized that \u201ceven if an underlying instrument is not a security, the manner in which participations in that instrument are used, pooled, or marketed might establish that such participations are securities.\u201d[15]\n\nThen, only two years later, a different panel of the same circuit court held that participations in mortgage loans were securities, which required the panel to consider a very similar factual situation and come out the opposite way.[16] But despite the fact that the Banco Espanol opinion was controversial and narrow from the start, and was undermined by a different ruling nearly immediately, it continues to reverberate. A vibrant market for broadly syndicated loans (or \u201cBSLs\u201d) now exists.\n\nAfter Banco\n\nIn some ways, a BSL looks like a loan to a company. Like a loan, companies can use the proceeds for any purpose, including purchasing equipment or issuing a dividend to their equity owners.\n\nIn other ways, BSLs look more like bonds. Evidence of the obligation is generally in the form of a \u201cnote\u201d purchased by institutional investors (not banks), such as investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds, CLOs, and various other non-bank financial institutions.[17] In addition, like a bond, a company generally will only make interest payments, with a single principal payment due all at once upon maturity.[18] BSLs are frequently structured to accommodate the market into which they are sold, and are designed to be relatively freely tradable among the institutions that invest in them.[19]\n\nIn the years since the Banco Espanol decision, the market for BSLs has continued to grow and evolve, including in ways that further undermine investor protections. Indeed, one cause of this undermining of investor protections may be the perception that federal securities laws do not apply. Recently, the SEC was asked to weigh in on whether a particular BSL met the definition of a security. The SEC did not weigh in, and the court ruled without such input.[20] While that case has now been decided, it brought new attention to an issue that had been steadily growing. But will this be the end?\n\nThe default assumption under Reves is that a particular instrument marketed as note is a security, and I am concerned that the lack of clear guidance on which factors are sufficient for a BSL to rebut that presumption is resulting in market confusion.[21] This could result in a court, or the SEC, being asked to weigh in again. This matters for both investors and the markets more broadly.[22] Here\u2019s why.\n\nInvestor Protection\n\nFirst, investor protection. I am aware that some commentators have argued that BSL investors do not need the protections of the securities laws because they are sophisticated institutions. Of course, institutional investors also need and deserve the protections of the federal securities laws. Consider the experience of institutional investors who purchased investments based on residential real estate before and during the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.[23]\n\nAnd, to be clear, it is not just institutional investors. Retail investors have enormous exposure to this market. For example, many of the vehicles that purchase BSLs are registered investment companies that focus on these types of assets, and these funds represent an important component of the market for BSLs.[24] These funds, in turn, are owned by retail investors. Even if it is the case that the parties making investment decisions understand the important protections they are giving up, do the underlying investors? Funds investing in BSLs have been heavily marketed to retail investors in recent years as a hedge against rising interest rates.[25] Less prominent, however, have been discussions of the differences in legal status between BSLs and other credit instruments like bonds. I believe it is unlikely that most retail investors in these funds would understand these nuances, and that they would reasonably expect their funds to have more legal protections than in fact exist.\n\nAt a minimum, investors benefit from the protections of the crucial antifraud rules of the federal securities laws, such as Rule 10b-5. This rule polices any materially false or misleading statements made to investors. Rule 10b-5 and other rules do more. Consider: do investors in BSLs have sufficient protection from the risks of insider trading? Investors in traditional securities benefit from the knowledge that the SEC has the power to police when insiders trade on the basis of material nonpublic information. The enhanced investor protection results in increased market efficiency because investors do not need to worry that the other side is trading on the basis of inside information.[26]\n\nWhen a BSL issuer encounters difficulty, it is common for some of the notes it has issued to be purchased by investors specializing in \u201cdistressed\u201d assets \u2014 that is, assets where the issuer may go bankrupt, and where a savvy investor can make a profit by understanding which parts of the issuer\u2019s capital structure are most likely to have a recovery. These investors also seek to profit by influencing the process by which the issuer seeks new capital to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nIn many cases, these distressed investors negotiate for access to nonpublic information about the issuer, which is not available to all holders of its notes. To the degree the underlying assets are not securities, investors may decide to trade on the basis of this inside information without disclosing it to the market. The future of a market rife with insider trading is concerning at best, especially for investors in funds that have not received the inside information (which generally includes the passive vehicles favored by retail investors). Investors will get hurt.\n\nIn addition, investors in securities rely on the vigilance of other participants in the process to ensure that an issuer discloses material information about its condition. In registered offerings, these are known as \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d and they exert a heavy influence in favor of investors. Of course, gatekeepers themselves can make mistakes (and we have seen lapses in the gatekeeping role lead to catastrophic results that affect the entire market).[27] As a whole, though, their influence helps promote confidence in the market by providing a second set of eyes on an issuer\u2019s disclosures before they reach investors.\n\nEven in unregistered offerings, where there is less of a role for a formal gatekeeper, the banks, accountants, and other service providers who participate in these offerings are motivated by the securities laws to ensure that the documents they produce are accurate and not misleading. But when the assets themselves are not registered, and are not even securities, do these participants exercise sufficient vigilance? In certain cases, we have seen that the answer is no, and that, when the participants are not subject to the securities laws, they are more willing not to disclose \u2014 and in some cases, to affirmatively hide \u2014 negative information about a company. They seem to rely on the caveat emptor doctrine that the securities laws were specifically designed to root out.[28]\n\nInstead of a strong gatekeeper, documents marketing BSLs to investors frequently contain what is known in the industry as a \u201cbig boy\u201d representation. That acknowledgment is designed to protect the bank intermediating the transaction from liability by requiring investors to represent that they have done their own diligence on the issuer of the notes. But frequently, investors have neither the means nor the time to conduct meaningful diligence. The loan is generally marketed to investors very late in the process after nearly all the terms are settled, and generally an investor\u2019s only real choice is whether to participate. While some might argue that this is evidence of investors exhibiting rational ignorance, meaning the market is working, I think it could also be evidence of a market failure\u2014 the vehicles purchasing BSLs are doing so with other people\u2019s money, and the bonuses of the people investing on behalf of those vehicles will be paid long before it is clear whether the BSLs at issue will perform in line with expectations.[29] This is a clear conflict. Shouldn\u2019t the expectations of the party who will actually be harmed be given precedence?\n\nIn many contexts, parties are not allowed to waive rights that are central to a particular regulatory scheme. In fact, recognizing the fundamental unfairness and power imbalances that can exist when powerful parties are able to manipulate the circumstances of a transaction, provisions in each of the major securities laws state that attempts to waive the protections of those laws are void.[30] In light of the remedial nature of the securities laws and the identity of many underlying investors, should we take a fresh look at assets that seem structured to avoid these important protections?\n\nSystemic Risk\n\nI am also concerned that risk has accumulated in the BSL market and that it may be reaching a scale that could affect the financial system more broadly.[31] These assets trade privately, preventing regulators like the SEC from fully assessing whether particular institutions have too much exposure, or whether other risks are brewing. Ultimately, the lack of these data could result in us being unable to detect risks that could affect the efficiency, fairness, or orderliness of our capital markets. And, if a negative outcome does ultimately occur, the same lack of data could also hamper our ability to effectively respond.\n\nWorse, the types of BSLs that look most similar to securities also seem to have characteristics that make them especially likely to have procyclical systemic effects on the market. Though BSLs trade regularly, many passive investors will only buy assets that trade on \u201cpar docs.\u201d This essentially means that they are not trading at a discount due to distress or potential distress at the borrower. In fact, many investors have strict guidelines that require them to sell BSLs even when they are downgraded below a certain level \u2014 well before the issuer is truly in distress. I am concerned that this can result in a procyclical cycle of sales which in turn could cause forced sales of other BSLs market-wide and affect the ability of companies to receive financing even though they are not otherwise distressed. The echoes of the 2008 financial crisis are hard to ignore.\n\nIn addition, as BSLs grow larger, they naturally need to be syndicated to more participants. But this also renders them especially vulnerable if problems develop. If investors sour on the market, (for example due to forced sales by market participants depressing prices throughout the market), the largest loans that depend on being especially widely syndicated are the ones that are most likely to get \u201chung\u201d on bank balance sheets and potentially affect financing to other companies.\n\nAs we continue to move into a new era of higher interest rates, these effects may become more apparent. For example, many companies took advantage of the near-zero interest rates of the pandemic and its immediate aftermath to borrow new money using BSLs. The amount of BSLs maturing in the next several years is more than any other comparable period in history.[32]\n\nThough it is still early innings, we are already seeing indications of what could happen when companies crash into this maturity wall. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, many companies engaged in \u201cextend and pretend\u201d transactions. These involved extending the maturity of the company\u2019s debt on the hope that financial conditions would improve but without any meaningful changes to the company\u2019s business. As of earlier this year, extend and pretend transactions were at their highest on record.[33] Though it appears this has not yet resulted in immediate negative effects, will our luck run out in future years?\n\nMany of the traditional passive investors in BSLs are not well-equipped to handle decisions requiring analysis of the issuer\u2019s business prospects. This has led to the rise of the \u201csnooze drag,\u201d where CLOs strategically do not take action on extension requests (allowing them to take effect by default).[34] This has resulted in investor complaints because the CLOs would otherwise be required to return their investors\u2019 money.\n\nTo me, a situation where many borrowers are seeking to refinance by extending their existing loans without any real changes, and can only do so by convincing their lenders to \u201csnooze\u201d is a flashing warning sign \u2013 what happens when borrowers\u2019 ability to engage in this tactic runs out? Will procyclical forced sales occur? And will regulators and the public be caught by surprise when this begins to affect the real economy?\n\nI should note that the two dynamics I have mentioned \u2014 investor protection and systemic risk \u2013 are interconnected. Markets in which securities protections are not present mean investors have less information, less confidence in the integrity of the information they do have, and fewer assurances that market participants will not abuse the trust investors place in them.[35] Without these rules, the market runs a higher risk of unraveling, with potentially systemic consequences for the real economy.[36] Greater disclosure and the greater integrity of disclosure that comes with antifraud rules, protections against insider trading, and gatekeepers would guard against the BSL market becoming a proverbial \u201cmarket for lemons.\u201d[37]\n\n* * * * *\n\nI would also like briefly to touch on several other areas that commentators have raised when discussing whether particular instruments described as notes, such as BSLs, should be regulated as securities. Though I believe consideration of these policy issues would not alter the application of the binding Supreme Court precedent in Reves, I believe they could merit some consideration so that regulators and the industry can work together to develop guidance on areas that may be unclear. In the face of uncertainty about the future development of the BSL market, it could be that regulators have work to do to prepare for a future ruling that certain BSLs are securities for purposes of the Securities Act.\n\nFirst, BSLs are frequently originated by large, national banks. I am aware that these banks are generally prohibited from underwriting securities, and that some have argued that if a court were to deem these widely syndicated notes securities, it could reduce capital formation. I believe further work is necessary to determine whether this is a realistic concern. Are there other arrangements a bank could make, such as conducting the activity through an affiliate? Would doing so require any additional regulatory actions from the SEC or banking regulators?\n\nSecond, these assets are already defined as securities for some purposes and not for others. For example, they are already treated as securities under the Investment Company Act.[38] What would prevent a banking regulator from issuing guidance stating that it would not deem widely syndicated loans to be securities for the purposes of the Volcker rule, even though the assets would be securities for other purposes?\n\n* * * * *\n\nThroughout my remarks today, I have referred to the global financial crisis of 2008. In the years leading up to that crisis, financial institutions had successfully convinced regulators that the laws and regulations enacted in the wake of the Great Depression could be loosened. They were able to point to decades without a crisis to argue that strict regulations were unnecessary and that the business of banking had become safer. Just over 25 years ago, the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management failed. Until its failure, many believed that hedge funds did not to pose a risk to the financial system.[39] This was because investments in these vehicles were privately placed to sophisticated investors who were capable of sustaining large losses. LTCM was run by Wall Street legends (including several Nobel laureates) who were viewed as some of the brightest minds in finance. But despite the apparent safety, the firm melted down over the course of a few weeks and ultimately required a multi-billion dollar bailout from its counterparties (at the strong urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York).[40] Its failure is one reminder that the non-occurrence of a crisis does not mean that one could never occur in the future. Regulators must be vigilant about the risks that are around the corner, not just the ones in the past.\n\nI am aware that some may argue that BSLs have only exhibited isolated problems, and that these problems alone are not necessarily evidence of systemic risk. It could be the case that this means BSLs will never cause systemic issues in the financial system. But, as in the years leading up to 2008, a metamorphosis in the system may be occurring before our eyes. I worry that this market is becoming riskier in ways that regulators have not yet fully considered. While some loan syndication may make sense to reduce the risk taken by individual banks, I am concerned that we are now in a world where banks lend, but nearly all the risk is transferred to investors who have no relationship with the borrower, and that investors \u2014 including retail investors \u2014 frequently have a great deal of exposure to these assets.[41] If that is to be the case, regulators across the board must assess whether investors have sufficient protection, and whether there are other risks to consider. For example, is the risk of BSLs compounded due to the lack of transparency, price discovery, and regulation of the private offerings through which BSLs are distributed to investors?\n\nConsideration of these issues now, before further problems develop, is necessary. Doing so allows us to ensure that a crisis does not threaten the fair, orderly, and efficient markets that we strive to maintain. I look forward to working with the public \u2014 including the people in this room today \u2014 to ensure that these outcomes do not occur. Thank you."}, {"title": "Five Takeaways From The MIA Market: \u201cNew World Order,\u201d Europe Steps Up & Public Broadcasters Go Hard - Deadline", "date": "Fri, 13 Oct 2023 09:26:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://deadline.com", "title": "Deadline"}, "text": "The MIA Market, Rome\u2019s splashy precursor to Mipcom Cannes, is almost over and there has been plenty to digest. Attendants from all over the world including a healthy dose of U.S. C-suite star power have been listening intently in the cinema screening rooms on the Piazza Barberini all week, and there has been plenty to discuss, as execs from around the world ponder a path to normality following a year of chaos and disruption. Meanwhile, the Israeli-Hamas conflict rages and the world mourns, with ripples felt here in Rome. See below for Deadline\u2019s key takeaways from the annual TV and film confab.\n\n\u201cNew world order\u201d\n\nIn the face of a year in which streaming models have at times felt on the verge of collapse and there have been dual U.S. labor strikes for the first time in six decades, a feeling of optimism and the charting of a forwards-path echoed within the halls of Cinema Barberini. American execs were here in force (attracted perhaps as much by the world-class food and beautiful sights as the draw of addressing a confab), with Paramount\u2019s Nicole Clemens, Miramax\u2019s Marc Helwig and Anonymous Content duo Davids Levine and Davoli all addressing delegates. While SAG-AFTRA\u2019s last-minute change of demands put a large spanner in the works, each took a future-facing approach to their keynotes. Helwig went into depth, positing a \u201cnew world order\u201d in which there will be \u201cmuch lower budgets\u201d and the market for first-look deals will \u201cfurther contract.\u201d That market contraction was a constant theme, with network execs and producers seeming to accept that the industry will not be going back to splashy days of yore, and Pulse Head of Scripted Judy Counihan dialled the prediction up to a \u201chuge contraction\u201d across the board during her panel session Tuesday. There was \u201ccertainly too much stuff\u201d commissioned during the streaming arms race,\u201d Helwig considered. This proliferation has potentially creeped into the U.S. agenting community, pondered Severance EP Nicholas Weinstock, who said the major agencies now have so many clients that they have become a \u201clittle more like portfolio managers, a little more like a bank.\u201d Each was positive, however, positing how this contraction will allow the market to slowly correct itself and could be a good thing for new talent. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to introduce entirely new filmmakers into the repertoire of our company,\u201d said Anonymous\u2019 Levine. Financing these projects is of course another matter, and multiple panel sessions were devoted to considerations around future funding models, co-productions and raising that all-important capital. Twas ever thus, but onwards we march.\n\nEurope steps up\n\nNetflix\n\nIt was the European head honchos who spoke in the most positive terms, finding that now is this continent\u2019s time to show why it is such a hub for TV and movies. \u201cHollywood should be jealous of what Spain is doing and our facilities allow for this,\u201d said Netflix\u2019s chief in Spain and Portugal bullishly on Thursday afternoon. The words \u2018authentic\u2019 and \u2018local\u2019 could be heard ringing around delegate\u2019s ears by the final day. One of the best-attended panels featured senior bods from Mediawan, Sony, Studiocanal and Universal International Studios, and optimism about Europe was the name of that game. Mediawan\u2019s Elisabeth D\u2019Arvieu said European production now has a \u201cbig competitive advantage\u201d over America and panellists listed a wealth of reasons why, including tax credits, favorable production hubs, local broadcasting ecologies and a \u201ccost-effective pool of talent.\u201d The notion of Europeans \u201cselling into the U.S\u201d and boosting exports in that direction was raised on several occasions. There are of course the aforementioned financing issues and plenty of strife remains with economies in flux but European delegates were showing serious resolve. As if on cue, CBS Studios unveiled Icelandic series The Darkness from Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, starring Enemies, A Love Story and Hunters star Lena Olin. As if on further cue, enter the New8\u2026\n\nPublic broadcasters go hard (but not home)\n\nL to R: Hans-J\u00f8rgen Osnes (NRK), Elly Vervloet (VRT), Simone Emmelius (ZDF), Anna Cronemann (SVT) and moderator Jon Ola Sand at the launch of New8 in Rome.\n\nReports of the death of public broadcasting have always been greatly exaggerated. In amongst virtually all U.S. streamers facing existential questions, these paragons of local culture have held firm and have been doing what they do best, and now they are collaborating big time. MIA\u2019s big announcement came via a Tuesday press conference and unveiling of \u201cthe biggest drama collaboration in Europe,\u201d as pubcasters in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium signed a contract to join the five Nordic broadcasters who make up the Nordic Twelve to form the New8. While confused journalists were left scratching their heads at how three plus 12 could possibly equal eight, bosses from each PSB spoke with confidence about how they will go about collaborating on eight TV series a year, which will be available in each member country. They will meet four times per year and submit projects to be funded by each territory, with four coming from the Nordics, two from Germany and one each from Belgium and the Netherlands. There was palpable excitement. Deadline spoke with execs throughout the week who were impressed with the resolve but met the New8 with a dose of scepticism, preferring to keep powder dry until projects begin to emerge and pondering the deeper ins-and-outs of the partnership or how it can avoid bureaucratic nightmare. But, more broadly, public broadcasting is felt to be in a good place. \u201cWe are staying relevant in a highly competitive landscape and fulfilling audience expectations,\u201d said the drama financing boss of Norway\u2019s NRK. A report into the local Italian industry is due out later today.\n\nDon\u2019t forget animation\n\nIn a canny move, MIA devoted more energy to animation and factual TV this year, broadening a market that has previously leaned on scripted. Various panels debated the topics of the day in animation and there were pitching sessions to help discover the next generation of talent. Flying the animated flag was Marge Dean, a doyen of the genre who runs Walking Dead maker Skybound Entertainment\u2019s Animation Studio. She argued passionately on day one for animation to be given a seat at the top table, breaking free \u201cfrom the kids and comedy box that it has been stuck in for decades.\u201d Dean had a ready-made example, Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Invincible, a show that had a budget four times less than the Boys with \u201cbarely\u201d any marketing and yet regularly hits the streamer\u2019s top-five most watched, she said. Dean also dismissed the AI threat, finding: \u201cIt\u2019s only a danger to creativity if we let it be.\u201d With question marks over scripted financing (they never stop) and anime and adult animation proving popular on streaming platforms, more networks may think about taking up Dean\u2019s mantra as we enter 2024.\n\nIsrael-Hamas conflict\n\nAmir Levy/Getty Images Amir Levy/Getty Images\n\nIt has been a sombre week for the international community. As delegates were heading to Rome, Hamas was attacking Israel and kidnapping dozens of citizens. Israel has long punched above its weight in TV and film and MIA recognized this, with talk of the growing conflict not dying down throughout the week. Oscar-nominated Waltz with Bashir director Ari Folman was due to keynote on animated docs but pulled out as the confab started. He was then due to address delegates remotely but this was also cancelled. Next week\u2019s Mipcom Cannes looks set to further highlight the plight of the Israeli and Palestinian communities in a conflict that the international community is beginning to understand will not be ending anytime soon. While the brunt of the Israeli delegation is no longer going to Mipcom, there will still be representatives from Israeli media companies who are based in other nations, and there will be plenty to discuss. For now, the world mourns."}, {"title": "Global Genetic Testing Market Research Report 2023-2027: Navigating Genetic Testing's Future - Predictive Diagnostics, Pharmacogenomics, and DTC Testing - Yahoo Finance", "date": "Wed, 11 Oct 2023 09:43:00 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Finance"}, "text": "Company Logo\n\nDublin, Oct. 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Genetic Testing Markets.

A lot of people say \u2018no,\u2019 and that\u2019s why you see massive inflows into money-market funds,\u201d says Bianco.\n\nHe says things are different now and it\u2019s not like 2019, when the big argument was TINA \u2014 or there is no alternative to the stock market.\n\nThe strategists pointed to other cards stacked against stocks, such as the lopsidedness caused by the seven Magnificent Seven tech darlings \u2014 Apple AAPL, -0.07% , Microsoft MSFT, +1.50% , Alphabet GOOGL, +1.26% , Amazon AMZN, +2.13% , Nvidia NVDA, +1.39% , Tesla TSLA, +1.12% and Meta Platforms META, +2.05% . .\n\n\u201cWhy is everything but seven stocks struggling? Because everybody\u2019s sitting there looking at a 5.5% [return] with no risk and they are saying, \u2018You know, call me when there is going to be a better opportunity in the market because right now I\u2019m just happy taking my 5.5% an sleeping well,'\u201d says Bianco.\n\nBianco says in recent years some of the investing population have avoided cryptos and other \u201csugar highs\u201d \u2014 he has referred to the stock market as being diabetic thanks to years of Fed stimulus and zero interest rates. Many of those are retirees who waited 15 years to get a decent return out of income investments.\n\n\u201cSo that crowd is coming back, and I think it\u2019s bringing more of a balance in the market,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd that brings him to his next point that investors are just too demanding these days, wanting the stock market to make them wealthy, offer morality through ESGs, fund their retirement and even entertain them. That\u2019s also a dangerous path for the market, he said.\n\n\u201cFor a moment there, from 2015 to 2019, it looked like it might be able to be all of those things at the same time, but that\u2019s because we were in a sugar rush,\u201d of Fed stimulus he said.\n\nSo investors are facing a time soon when they need to decide what they want from stocks. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have to make some hard choices and I think that\u2019s part of this transition.\u201d\n\nEven the Fed, Bianco says, wants the stock market to work for it as a policy tool \u2014 dropping when it wants the economy to slow down, and rising when it wants the economy to speed back up. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got all these competing forces that are trying to make the stock market do too many things all at once,\u201d he said.\n\nOne fading breed out there? Those hoping for a stock crash so that they can go on a buying spree until the Fed starts printing money and pushing the market higher, says Bianco.\n\nRead: Time for big shift from stocks to credit as \u2018easy money\u2019 ends, says billionaire investor Howard Marks\n\nThe markets\n\nStocks ES00, -0.27% NQ00, -0.29% are a bit lower after mixed inflation data, while Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y are creeping up.

The change caused Needham Market more problems towards the end, with Akinyemi finding himself wide open as he shot low at his near post forcing Marcus Garnham to make a crucial save.\n\nThe inform striker who has bagged 8 goals this season, couldn\u2019t find the finishing touch against a tough team to break down.

Since 2022, the County Board has established several new uses for commercial buildings\u2014urban agriculture, research and development, commercial and ghost kitchens, and micro-fulfillment centers, among others.\n\nRELATED: Read frequently asked questions about CMRI\n\n\"We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in our commercial market that has fundamentally changed how people work and how businesses operate, both in Arlington and nationally,\" Board Chair Christian Dorsey said. \"Our challenge is to adapt to this new environment while leveraging all that makes Arlington great. The CMRI 2.0 continues our commitment to modernizing our approach to Arlington's regulations and processes, and to working quickly to find solutions that ensure our community remains resilient and world-class.\"\n\nHistorically, Arlington had close to a 50/50 split in its tax revenue between commercial property taxes and residential property taxes. As more workers enter a hybrid or remote model, more companies are letting leases expire or downsizing their office space. These office vacancies impact the value of commercial buildings, which affects property taxes. A decline in commercial property taxes shifts more of the tax burden to residential property owners. When revenues decrease, County services and programs that benefit everyone are impacted.\n\nMORE: CMRI Fact Sheet\n\nCMRI 2.0 is designed to address the changing commercial and fiscal reality. It will focus on five strategic areas: office conversion, repositioning, redevelopment, tenant support, and placemaking.\n\nStaff has identified several workstreams that will allow the County to work on all strategic areas simultaneously. The workstreams include planning processes (Special GLUP Studies, minor and major Site Plan amendments), the sign ordinance, parking regulations, green building incentives, and conversion of office buildings, among others.\n\nThe workstreams will not be considering wholesale changes to existing policies or regulations. Instead, they will examine specific areas where increased flexibility could result in new opportunities to stabilize and improve the commercial portion of the County\u2019s tax base.\n\nEach workstream will have its own timeline and community engagement with stakeholders, both of which will be guided by the subject matter and its potential impact on the community. Items will be brought before the County Board incrementally, with the first one not expected until 2024.\n\nCounty Manager Mark Schwartz noted, \u201cFor us to thrive, we need to respond quickly and thoughtfully to the new market. We welcome input from residents and commercial property owners. I am convinced we can adjust our approach, but it will only happen with changes to some of our practices and by working with the community to ensure we remain true to the vision of the County.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the Commercial Market Resiliency Initiative and get the latest updates on the CMRI webpage.\n\nPhoto Gallery"}, {"title": "Fulton Market Misses Out On 500 Affordable Units As Developers ... - Block Club Chicago", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:51:07 GMT", "publisher": {"href": "https://blockclubchicago.org", "title": "Block Club Chicago"}, "text": "WEST LOOP \u2014 Over the past two years, Fulton Market has missed out on more than 500 affordable units as developers skirt a city goal to provide more affordable housing in the booming neighborhood.\n\nIn 2021, the city lifted a decades-long ban on new residential developments north of Lake Street in Fulton Market, opening a new frontier of housing in an area that had been largely restricted to office, hotel and commercial buildings.\n\nThe moratorium\u2019s end allows residential development within what\u2019s known as the Kinzie Corridor Overlay District, an area bounded by Ogden Avenue, Carroll Avenue, Hubbard Street, Halsted and Wayman Streets.\n\nIn lifting the ban, the Chicago Plan Commission, Department of Housing and Department of Planning and Development set a goal of 30 percent affordable housing units for new residential developments inside the Fulton Market Innovation District north of Lake Street. Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance currently mandates 20 percent of units are affordable citywide.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022, residential development proposals were expected to \u201ccooperate with the City in good faith\u201d to apply for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction of the additional 10 percent in affordable units. This agreement was laid out in every development proposal approved by the city.\n\nBut none of the seven developments approved by City Council from 2021 to 2022 located north of Lake Street in the Fulton Market Innovation District attained subsidies to build additional affordable units beyond the 20 percent already mandated by the city, according to the Department of Housing.\n\nArea of the Fulton Market Innovation District located North of Lake Street.\n\nThe extension of the Kinzie Industrial Corridor Tax-Increment Financing (TIF) District at the end of 2022 opened up a whole new funding source for developers to offset the cost of the additional 10 percent affordable units.\n\nFour projects approved this year north of Lake Street in the Fulton Market Innovation District have not applied for the TIF subsidy, according to the Department of Housing. All four were approved by City Council with 20 percent affordability.\n\nBut that changed after local Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) found out the city wasn\u2019t delivering on its promise to bring 30 percent affordability to the area.\n\nBurnett told Block Club Chicago he was disappointed the city\u2019s development team and developers were not delivering on the city\u2019s stated 30 percent goal.\n\n\u201cI feel bamboozled because I\u2019m assuming that they were getting what they asked for,\u201d Burnett said.\n\nIn a September Planning Commission meeting, Burnett revealed he intervened to ensure the most recent proposal for the district, at 800 W. Lake St., would include 30 percent affordable units. The 36-story building by Ascend Real Estate Group, once imagined as a hotel, will feature 406 apartments, and 122 of them will be affordable if the subsidy comes through.\n\n\u201cNone of those other buildings that we voted on, have committed to those [30 percent] aspirations because the city hasn\u2019t committed to their part of the aspiration where they [were] supposed to subsidize,\u201d Burnett said. \u201d \u2026 We need to change something. Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a hoax.\u201d\n\nAld. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) at a City Council meeting at City Hall on June 21, 2023.\n\nBurnett said he\u2019s disappointed he has to stay on top of the city to incorporate its own affordable housing goals in new developments.\n\n\u201cI got to not only baby developers, but I got to stay on the city\u2019s housing department,\u201d Burnett told Block Club Chicago. \u201cWe need to try to come up with our portion of the deal.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the city\u2019s Department of Housing said the issue is nuanced. Developers have not secured subsidies because those chose not to apply after learning about their options.\n\nThanks to a break from Springfield, developers citywide who build required affordable units on-site qualify for a reduction on their property tax assessment. In exchange for the tax break, the units must remain affordable for 30 years.\n\nThis tax break has led to a boom in affordable units that will come online in the next three to four years Downtown and across the West Loop. But developers haven\u2019t been willing to pull the trigger on 30 percent affordability for proposals north of Lake Street.\n\nBefore TIF funding became an option, developers could also apply for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit allows property owners to claim tax credits in return for making part of a development affordable.\n\nBut regulations with the tax credit would make it hard, and in some cases impossible, for developers to sell the building after it\u2019s completed. After learning about the subsidy through the city, the seven developers did not apply for it, according to Daniel Hertz, director of policy research and legislative affairs for the Department of Housing.\n\nDevelopers found the tax credit can create issues with resale \u201cor it\u2019s too complex. It takes too long,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nPeople walking through Fulton Market.\n\nDevelopers for the seven proposals approved between 2021-2022, did not respond to requests for comment. They include Sterling Bay, LG Development, Fulton St. Companies, Trammell Crow and Shapack Partners. Combined, these developments bypassed including about 270 additional affordable units under the 30 percent goal.\n\nFour developments approved this year have yet to attain building permits and are still able to apply for TIF subsidies. They are located at 1300 W. Carroll Ave., 1300 W. Lake St., 375 N. Morgan St. and 370, 400-01 N. Morgan St. Combined, these developments could provide an additional 287 affordable units under the stated 30 percent goal.\n\nBlock Club Chicago reached out to developers associated with these four proposals, none of them responded to request for comment on applying for the available TIF subsidy.\n\nIn total with the developments, 5,609 units were approved but developers passed on making 557 of them affordable to meet the 30 percent goal.\n\nThe Department of Housing has contacted all four developers to discuss the possibility of applying for TIF funding to fund the additional affordable units, city officials said.\n\n\u201cIn general, the use of TIF requires a supplemental multi-family affordable housing TIF application, which must be submitted at least six months prior to the first vertical building permit,\u201d a Department of Housing spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe process starts with a review from the the city\u2019s internal TIF Investment Committee, and then goes to the Community Development Commission, City Council\u2019s finance committee and eventually the full City Council for approval.\n\nThe proposed development at 800 W. Lake St. by Ascend Real Estate Group \u2014 which has yet to be approved by City Council \u2014 is the only development to attempt to tap into TIF funding to achieve 30 percent affordability.\n\n\u201cIf you can pull surplus out of the TIF to balance the budget, you can pull surplus out of the TIF to build affordable housing,\u201d Burnett said.\n\nRenderings for a 43-story, 460-unit apartment building at 375 N. Morgan St. in the West Loop\n\nDepartment of Planning and Development acting Commissioner Patrick Murphey said the 800 W. Lake St. deal could serve as a model for others if it\u2019s approved by City Council.\n\n\u201c\u2026 If we can find agreement with Council, Department of Housing, Law Department, and administration \u2026 we would look at putting that forward as a template version of what the ARO and TIF obligations could result in \u2026 in Fulton market,\u201d Murphey said at a September meeting. \u201cThere are a lot of \u2018ifs\u2019 in there.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

The lockers will allow customers to pick up their food when it's convenient for them.\n\n\u201cWhen healthy food options are convenient, more people can use and benefit from them. The result is better health outcomes for the community,\" Mid-Ohio Food Collective President and CEO Matt Habash said in a statement.\n\nThe food collective has expanded its hours and locations in the past several years, but this new service will broaden access for local people even more.\n\nThis is the first time the collective is offering the locker service and they believe it is the first of its kind in Ohio, though in recent months food pantries across the nation have begun to introduce similar systems. They can also be found in some grocery stores.\n\n\"It's our new experiment in serving people in our community,\" Habash said on Tuesday. \"It's a way for us to serve. ... A new way to be truly customer centric.\"\n\nThe lockers aren't meant to replace the choice included in a shopping experience at a Mid-Ohio Market, instead it's for those who aren't able to get to the market during its opening hours.\n\nShoppers can use the system for free by ordering online at www.orderahead.org and then being assigned a locker number, a pick-up window and a PIN to get their items. Orders are refrigerated and secure until pickup and include a variety of refrigerated items, like produce, and shelf-stable foods.\n\nAs the city grows, not all rise: Can Columbus turn the tide of rising homelessness and food insecurity? Officials think so\n\n\u201cThis system will make it easier for working families in Columbus to get fresh, healthy food at times that work for their busy schedules,\" Habash said.\n\nAfter being tested, the 72 lockers are now available to the wider community, with the potential of offering three dozen families per day food access.\n\nThe orange lockers and green vestibule are located on the side of the Norton Road Market, emblazoned with the words: \"Your groceries. At your convenience. Cool and fresh.\" on them in English and Spanish.\n\nHumana Healthy Horizons, a health plan that manages Medicaid benefits for thousands of Ohioans, invested money to make the lockers possible, according to the food collective.\n\nThe plan's partnership with the collective includes more than $1.25 million focusing on ending hunger by addressing social determinants of food insecurity and poverty.\n\nThe collective reported seeing an \"unprecedented\" need and record demand for food across its 680 partner sites in 20 area counties earlier this year. From Jan. 1 to Oct. 1, people received food assistance at its locations more than 1.3 million times, according to the collective's data, up 35% from the same time in 2022.\n\n'Unprecedented' need: Central Ohio food banks, pantries experiencing 40% increase in demand\n\nHumana and the collective hosted a public launch and ribbon cutting event Tuesday at the Norton Road market.\n\n\u201cHumana Healthy Horizons is committed to eliminating the barriers that impact the health of the communities we serve,\u201d said Kathie Mancini, vice president of Humana Healthy Horizons - Ohio, in a statement. \u201cBy working with MOFC on vital programs like this one, we can help ensure everyone in the mid-Ohio region has access to healthy, nourishing food.\u201d\n\nNext, the food collective hopes to put the lockers in other locations, including rural areas where pantry hours may be more limited. There are also discussions about putting a set at the new COTA Rickenbacker Mobility Center, Habash said.\n\n\"It really lives into what we call a food is health strategy,\" Habash said, during the ribbon cutting event. \"The ability to really connect people is what this has ben all about.\"\n\ndking@dispatch.com\n\n@DanaeKing"}]
